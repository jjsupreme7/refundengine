description: Clean up test files and temporary code
---

Clean up the project by:

1. **Find and delete test files:**
   - Files matching: `*_test.*`, `test_*.py`, `*.tmp`, `*.bak`
   - Files in `/tmp/` directories
   - Show me what you find before deleting

2. **Remove unnecessary code:**
   - Commented-out code blocks
   - Unused imports
   - Duplicate functions
   - Debug print statements

3. **Check for outdated files:**
   - Old scripts no longer referenced
   - Deprecated folders

Be proactive but ASK before deleting anything that might be important.
