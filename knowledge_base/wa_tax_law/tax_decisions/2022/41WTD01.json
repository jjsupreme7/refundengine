  "summary": "A taxpayer that operates an automotive repair and maintenance business disputes the assessment of deferred sales tax on certain purchases of capital assets and consumables used in its services. The taxpayer says it has additional documents to support adjustments to tax imposed on those purchases, and asserts that the Department erroneously counted a large invoice twice in the audit.The taxpayer also contests the assessment of use tax on certain transactions where it alleges it provided substantially discounted services to customers who redeemed certain coupons, rather than providing those services for free. The taxpayer argues that the services were not promotions subject to use tax, but were instead retail sales taxable only on the cash surrender value of the coupon and the customer\u2019s goodwill. Alternatively, the taxpayer argues that deferred sales tax, not use tax, is the proper tax, and tax should be based on its purchase price from its vendor. We deny the petition in part, grant it in part, and remand to the operating division to make adjustments accordingly.",
