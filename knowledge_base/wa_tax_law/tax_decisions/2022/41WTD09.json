  "summary": "A company that managed a parking garage protests the Department\u2019s denial of the company\u2019s request for a refund of retail sales tax and B&O tax. The company collected the retail sales tax from a customer on sales of reserved parking spaces, the prices for which the company listed as inclusive of retail sales tax, and remitted the taxes to the Department. The company also remitted retailing B&O tax on the income it generated from the same sales. The company later discovered that such sales are considered rentals of real estate and are exempt from retail sales tax. We find that the company is not entitled to a refund of the sales tax because it was the customer, not the company, that paid the tax, and the company has not refunded the taxes to the customer. However, the company is entitled to a refund of the B&O tax it paid on its income from those sales because such sales are specifically exempt from B&O tax. The petition is denied in part, granted in part, and remanded to the operating division for adjustment.",
