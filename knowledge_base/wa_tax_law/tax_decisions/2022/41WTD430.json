  "date": "11/30/2022",
  "summary": "A real property owner that harvested timber from his property disputes the Department\u2019s disallowance of claimed harvesting and marketing deductions, and assessment of additional timber tax liability, delinquent penalty, and interest. The owner asserts that the Department incorrectly disallowed the claimed deductions as charges for land clearing or stump removal. Because the owner did not provide records from which the Department may separate Taxpayer\u2019s costs for qualifying and non-qualifying activities, the Department correctly determined that the owner was eligible to claim a 35 percent deduction for harvesting and marketing costs. We deny in part and grant in part, the petition.",
