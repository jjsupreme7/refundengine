  "summary": "A distributor of grocery items asserts that its approved refund claim was improperly subject to offset amounts arising in a concurrent audit of the company\u2019s Washington tax liability. The company asserts that any offsets should be limited to the type of tax at issue in the refund and by the nonclaim period that would apply to the assessment of the taxes used for the offset. We find that there is no basis to limit the offsets to the specific type of tax at issue in the refund request. As to the offset, because the provisions of WAC 458-20-229 specifically anticipate the review of new information to reduce a refund claim, we find the offset at issue was proper. The Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
