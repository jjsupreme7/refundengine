  "summary": "A Washington company whose owner resides . . . [outside of the United States] protests the Department\u2019s assessment of retail sales tax and retailing business and occupation (\u201cB&O\u201d) tax on retail sales made to Washington consumers. The company argues that despite the fact that it was formed in Washington, it did not establish nexus with Washington during the relevant periods because it had no physical presence in the state. We conclude that the company did indeed have a physical presence in Washington because its owner/sole employee was present in the state as the company\u2019s registered agent and the company owned a bank account in Washington, maintained a physical mailbox in Washington, and used a Washington-based answering service to interact with its Washington customers. For those reasons, we find that the company did have nexus with Washington throughout the subject periods and is subject to Washington retail\u00a0sales tax and B&O tax as assessed. Petition denied.",
