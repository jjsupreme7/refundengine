  "summary": "A LLC that owns property in Washington protests the assessment of REET on one of its members\u2019 acquisition of a controlling interest in the company. It asserts: that the transfer was exempt from REET under RCW 82.45.010(3)(j) and WAC 458-61A-208(5) as an execution of a judgment, that there was no sale price upon which to assess REET, and that there was no consideration. We conclude that REET is due on the transfer. The taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
