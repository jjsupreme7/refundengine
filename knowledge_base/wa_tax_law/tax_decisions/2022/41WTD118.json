  "summary": "A company providing [electronic] account access services to credit unions seeks reconsideration of our determination affirming the assessment of tax on digital automated services (DAS), asserting that the services fit within a number of exclusions from DAS and that the taxation of these services is prohibited by the Internet Tax Freedom Act. We affirm our decision that the activities at issue were properly classified as DAS and that the taxation of the services at issue is not prohibited by the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
