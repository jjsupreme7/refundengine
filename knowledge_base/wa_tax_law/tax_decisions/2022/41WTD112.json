  "summary": "An information technology company that specializes in project management services and customization of preprogrammed business management software for clients protests the Department\u2019s disallowance of a business and occupation (\u201cB&O\u201d) tax credit offered to companies engaged in \u201cqualified research and development.\u201d The company argues that because its business activities involve \u201ctranslating technical and nonroutine activities into new or improved processes and software,\u201d it was engaged in the type of research and development for which the credit is available. In fact, the company\u2019s activities do not satisfy the Department\u2019s definition of the term \u201cnonroutine,\u201d thus the activities cannot be considered \u201cresearch and development\u201d and the company does not qualify for the credit. Petition denied.",
