  "summary": "A port district protests the Department\u2019s tax ruling dated October 30, 2019. The port argues that the Department\u2019s Taxpayer Information and Education (\u201cTI&E\u201d) section erroneously concluded that the port would be responsible for leasehold excise tax (\u201cLET\u201d) on leases it will assume when it purchases a building with existing tenants. We deny the petition.",
