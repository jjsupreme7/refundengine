  "summary": "A business (Taxpayer) that provides aircraft-related ground services, equipment rental, fuel sales, and fueling services, disputes its assessment on several grounds. First, Taxpayer argues that it paid fuel tax on certain purchases of fuel it sold or used, so it should not also be assessed sales or use tax on the same fuel. Alternatively, Taxpayer argues that if use tax is due, fuel usage for 2014 was overestimated. Next, Taxpayer argues that it collected and remitted retail sales tax on certain rental sales that was not taken into consideration in the audit. Finally, Taxpayer disputes the inclusion of its refueling service income in the retail sales price of its related fuel sales, arguing that the fueling services were charged in line items separate from the charges for fuel. On those grounds, Taxpayer contends that the fueling services are not subject to sales tax. We deny the petition",
