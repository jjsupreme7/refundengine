  "summary": "A . . . company that produces aluminum ingots from recyclable aluminum disputes the Department\u2019s tax assessment because the company asserts that it is an aluminum smelter and qualifies for the preferential B&O tax rate. The company further asserts that its nexus with Washington ended on December 31, 2015. . . . We deny the petition because the company is not a direct service industrial customer, it does not process alumina into aluminum, and its wholesale sales are subject to economic nexus standards.",
