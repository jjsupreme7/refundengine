  "summary": "A portrait photography business protests the Department\u2019s assessment of retail sales tax on its sales of digital photographs on the grounds that it provides \u201cphotography for hire\u201d services, which are not subject to retail sales tax. However, the contract that the business has its customers sign before each transaction specifies that the sale includes edited images, which are produced and edited by the business before being electronically transferred to the customer. Because electronically transferred images are considered a \u201cdigital good,\u201d and sales of digital goods are subject to retail sales tax, we conclude that the Department properly classified the business\u2019s sales as retail sales. Petition denied.",
