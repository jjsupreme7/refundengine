  "summary": "An individual disputes the DOR\u2019s denial of a partial refund of use tax the individual paid to the DOL to title and register a sailboat in his name. The individual asserts that the price at which he purchased the sailboat, which is less than one quarter of DOL\u2019s valuation, is the proper basis for calculating the use tax and he is entitled to a refund of use tax paid in excess of this. We grant the petition.",
