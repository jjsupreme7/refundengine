  "summary": "A construction company disputes its tax assessment, arguing that the audit should have been based on cash basis rather than accrual basis accounting, and that its claimed wholesale sales should not have been reclassified as retail sales. The taxpayer also asserts that it had a client that paid subcontractors directly for\u00a0certain services they performed on a construction\u00a0project where taxpayer acted as the prime contractor,\u00a0and it never received these payments. We deny the petition.",
