  "summary": "An out-of-state law firm protests the assessment of tax, asserting that it does not have substantial nexus with Washington, and that the Department incorrectly apportioned its income to Washington. Taxpayer further contests the assessment of interest and penalties on the basis that the Department delayed in explaining its position and issuing the tax assessment. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition in part and grant Taxpayer\u2019s petition in part.",
