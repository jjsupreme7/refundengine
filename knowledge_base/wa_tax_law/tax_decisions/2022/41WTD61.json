  "summary": "A taxpayer disputes the assessment of use tax and penalties on his purchase of a travel trailer claiming that, because the trailer was purchased in another state and was subsequently sold to a nonresident company from [out of state], the purchase should be exempt from use tax in Washington. . . . The taxpayer also claims that [we should waive penalties because] he relied on incorrect information obtained from an internet website. We deny the petition.",
