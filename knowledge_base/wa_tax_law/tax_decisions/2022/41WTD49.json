  "date": "02/04/2022",
  "summary": "A dental laboratory protests the Department\u2019s assessment of use tax, arguing that its dental models should be subject to retail sales tax, not use tax. Alternatively, the laboratory argues that if they are subject to use tax then the Department should use the laboratory\u2019s cost valuation methodology as a basis for the measure of use tax. Taxpayer also argues that its refractory die labor and material are exempt from use tax as a prosthetic device. We deny the petition.",
