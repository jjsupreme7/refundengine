  "summary": "A company that operates a gym protests the Department\u2019s assessment of retail sales tax on fees the company charged to a personal training business for the use of the gym to host fitness classes. The company argues that its relationship with the personal training business is a \u201cpartnership\u201d and the fees it collected are not for use of the facility but a \u201cpartnership fee.\u201d However, the contract between the parties specifically states that they did not intend to establish a partnership. Because fees charged to personal trainers by gym operators for using the operator\u2019s facilities are subject to retail sales tax under RCW 82.04.050(3)(g)(i), we conclude that company is liable for retail sales tax on those amounts. Petition denied.",
