  "summary": "A manufacturer of replacement components for industrial equipment, which also incorporates replacement components in repairs of industrial equipment, seeks review of the Department\u2019s disallowance of the manufacturing machinery and equipment sales and use tax exemption. The taxpayer asserts that the Department incorrectly concluded that only fabricating components for sale independent of repair constitutes manufacturing and qualifies for the exemption. The Department concludes that the taxpayer\u2019s fabrication of components for both purposes\u2014to incorporate during repair and for sale independent of repair\u2014is manufacturing in a manufacturing operation, qualifying for the machinery and equipment sales and use tax exemption. The Department grants the petition.",
