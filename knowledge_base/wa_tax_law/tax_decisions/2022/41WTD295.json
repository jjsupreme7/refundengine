  "summary": "A construction business protests the penalty portion of an assessment issued by the Department following an audit. The subject penalties include an evasion penalty, delinquent payment penalties, and a substantial underpayment penalty. Taxpayer argues that it did not intend to evade payment of its tax liabilities and, instead, the underpayments were the result of its owner\u2019s lack of understanding of Washington\u2019s tax laws. We conclude that the Department has established by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the business knew of the subject tax liabilities, but sought to evade paying the liabilities through deceit, fraud, or intentional wrongdoing. We also conclude that the business is ineligible for a penalty waiver because the circumstances that led to the penalties were not beyond the control of the business. Petition denied.",
