  "summary": "Taxpayers that [facilitate third-party merchant sales] dispute the assessment of delinquent penalties related to their failure to timely file annual reconciliation returns to correct reporting of their apportionable income. Taxpayers say they initially did not believe they had apportionable income, so they did not report apportionable income on their original excise tax returns. Because they did not report apportionable income on their original returns, Taxpayers assert, there was no apportionable income to later reconcile, and thus no duty to file annual reconciliations. Absent a duty to file annual reconciliations, Taxpayers argue, penalties associated with failure to timely file annual reconciliations do not apply to them.Taxpayers argue alternatively that penalties should be waived on the asserted grounds that Taxpayers entered into certain managed audit agreements with the Department, where the parties agreed on set amounts of tax, interest, and total penalties, which did not include delinquent penalties related to untimely filed annual reconciliations. We deny the petitions.",
