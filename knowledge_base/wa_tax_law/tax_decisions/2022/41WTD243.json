  "summary": "Two pharmacy benefit managers protest B&O tax assessed on their business activities on multiple grounds. First, they argue that amount received from affiliated entities should be exempted from B&O tax under RCW 82.04.320 as gross income from \u201cinsurance business\u201d upon which a gross premiums tax has been paid to the state. The pharmacy benefit managers also argue the Department is bound by the holding of an unpublished Washington Court of Appeals opinion that RCW 82.04.320 is not limited to insurance companies under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Next, they argue that payments received as \u201creimbursement\u201d for amounts paid to pharmacies for dispensing prescription drugs should be excluded from gross income as \u201cpass-through payments\u201d under WAC 458-20-111. Finally, the two taxpayers assert that the Department improperly reclassified amounts they derived from the sale of prescription drugs as subject to B&O tax under the \u201cservice and other activities\u201d tax classification. We deny the petition in part, grant it in part, and remand it for adjustment to the tax assessments.",
