  "summary": "An outdoor lighting company protests the imposition of the evasion penalty on retail sales tax that the company collected, but did not remit to the Department of Revenue. The taxpayer\u2019s owner claims that he did not willfully fail to remit the collected retail sales tax under WAC 458-20-228(5)(f)(ii) (Rule 228) because he did not know how to remit the taxes and had difficulty filling out the combined excise tax returns because of his medical condition. We uphold the evasion penalty.",
