  "summary": "Taxpayer appeals the assessment of deferred sales tax on a contract for demolition and excavation work performed at a manufacturing facility. The demolition and excavation work was for the removal of foundations in the facility after obsolete milling equipment was removed and before new milling equipment was installed. The Department holds that the demolition and excavation contract is to be evaluated independently from the contracts for other activities related to the removal and installation project. The Department further holds that the demolition and excavation work performed does not constitute \u201cinstallation\u201d of qualifying machinery and equipment and is therefore not subject to a retail sales tax exemption. Taxpayer\u2019s appeal is denied.",
