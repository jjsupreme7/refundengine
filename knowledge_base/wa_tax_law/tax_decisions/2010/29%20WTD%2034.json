  "summary": "A manufacturer of an electronic product protests the assessment of retail sales tax on chemicals used in its manufacturing process based on its belief that the chemicals qualify as \u201cchemicals used in processing\u201d and contain the necessary attributes for exemption detailed in RCW 82.04.050(1)(c) [and] WAC 458-20-113. We conclude that the Taxpayer has not established that the primary purpose of the chemicals at issue is to create a chemical reaction directly through contact with an ingredient of a new article being produced for sale. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the exemption for the resist chemicals, the developer, and the strip chemicals.",
