  "summary": "A fuel dealer-franchisee requests a refund of B&O tax.  Because the franchisee\u2019s customers were liable only to the dealer-franchisee who billed them, we conclude that the franchisee purchased and resold the fuel to its customers at whatever location they purchased the fuel. We deny the petition for refund.",
