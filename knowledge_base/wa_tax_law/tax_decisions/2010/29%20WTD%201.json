  "summary": "A special purpose district purchased industrial real property, and, as part of the consideration, agreed to allow the seller to use vehicle parking and storage on a portion of the property for a certain number of years. The Department of Revenue\u2019s Special Programs Division assessed leasehold excise tax on the value assigned to the above consideration. The taxpayer appeals this assessment claiming that the arrangement is not a lease subject to the leasehold excise tax. We deny taxpayer\u2019s petition and conclude that this arrangement is a lease subject to the leasehold excise tax.",
