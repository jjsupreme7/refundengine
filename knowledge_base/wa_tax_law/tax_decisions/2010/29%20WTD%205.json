  "summary": "Taxpayer, a retailer and wholesaler of cigars and tobacco related products, seeks a refund of Other Tobacco Products (OTP) tax, arguing that the OTP tax structure prior to July 1, 2005, suffers from several constitutional defects. We find that taxpayer failed to provide the Department with sufficient substantiation under RCW 82.32.060 and WAC 458-20-229 regarding its refund request, and therefore the Department is unable to consider taxpayer\u2019s arguments. Accordingly, we deny taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
