  "summary": "Two affiliated entities that operate retail stores in Washington protest the assessment of service and other activities B&O tax on certain amounts received from a third-party retailer with which Taxpayers contracted. Taxpayers argue that the amounts received from the third-party were for a lease of real property and not subject to B&O tax. Taxpayers further protest the assessment of retailing B&O tax on sales of the third-party\u2019s merchandise that Taxpayers completed in their stores on behalf of the third-party retailer. Finally, Taxpayers protest future reporting instructions in which they were instructed to remit directly to the Department \u2013 as opposed to the third-party retailer \u2013 all retail sales tax they collected on their sales of the third-party\u2019s merchandise. We deny Taxpayers\u2019 petition on all issues.",
