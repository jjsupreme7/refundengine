  "summary": "A jewelry gallery protests an assessment of service and other B&O on the gallery\u2019s commission income. The gallery argues it does not have to pay taxes on amounts received as commission for sales of goods sold on consignment. We conclude that Taxpayer has not overcome the presumption that it is selling goods in its own name, is subject to retailing B&O tax and retail sales tax on the proceeds of the sales, and remand the assessment to the Operating Division to adjust it accordingly.",
