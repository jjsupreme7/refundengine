  "summary": "A vehicle restoration business disputes the denial of Interstate and Foreign Sales deductions, and resulting assessment of retail sales tax, on income it derived from progress payments paid for restoration work performed on vehicles for nonresidents. The vehicles were located in this state when the progress payments were made, prior to out-of-state delivery to nonresidents, or delivery of the vehicles to common or bona fide carriers consigned to out-of-state delivery to nonresidents. Because the payments were made for interstate sales to nonresidents, we conclude that the business is allowed to take the Interstate and Foreign Sales deduction for income derived from such progress payments during the audit period.However, if Taxpayer is later unable to show that completed sales meet the statutory requirements to qualify for the nonresident sales tax exemption, Taxpayer will be liable for any unpaid sales tax on those sales. We grant the petition, and remand to the operating division for adjustments to the assessment",
