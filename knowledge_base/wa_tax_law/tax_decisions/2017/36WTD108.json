  "summary": "An out-of-state corporation that provides apartment listing services to property owners and property management companies protests the Department\u2019s assessment [of] use tax/deferred sales tax on the toll-free number service purchased from a vendor. Taxpayer argues that the sales are not retail sales because the primary purpose of its purchases is to collect the data from the callers and, thus, the sales qualify for the data processing and information services [exclusion] under RCW 82.04.065(27)(a). We deny the petition.",
