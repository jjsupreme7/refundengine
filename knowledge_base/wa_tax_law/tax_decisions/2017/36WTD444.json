  "summary": "A commercial bank in the business of originating, managing, and servicing credit cards protests an assessment, asserting that it lacks substantial nexus with Washington. Alternatively, it asserts that the private label card business is distinct and separate from its general credit card business so income was incorrectly apportioned. We conclude that the Taxpayer has taxing nexus with Washington, and that the Taxpayer has failed to provide sufficient detail to support adjustment to the apportionment approach applied during the audit and, accordingly, deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
