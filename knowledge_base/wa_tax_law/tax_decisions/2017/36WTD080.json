  "summary": "A company engaged in the business of providing proxy voting services to brokerage houses and banks petitions for correction of assessment of retail sales tax and retailing B&O tax on the processing fees and intermediary fees it charges its customers. We hold that the company\u2019s proxy voting services are taxable under the service and other activities B&O tax classification for periods prior to July 26, 2009. However, we hold that the company\u2019s proxy voting services are taxable as digital automated services for periods after July 26, 2009, and are therefore, subject to the retail sales tax and retailing B&O tax for those periods. . . . Taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted in part and denied in part.",
