  "summary": "A Taxpayer protests the assessment of REET on saw mill equipment sold in conjunction with the sale of real property. It asserts that the equipment was tangible personal property not subject to REET. We conclude that this equipment is tangible personal property rather than fixtures subject to REET and, accordingly, grant the Taxpayer\u2019s petition and remand to the Special Programs Division to adjust the assessment.",
