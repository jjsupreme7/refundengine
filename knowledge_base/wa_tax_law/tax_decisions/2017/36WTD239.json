  "summary": "A mechanical engineering and product development services provider protests the assessment of use tax and/or deferred retail sales tax on the materials it used to produce prototypes as part of its mechanical engineering and product design services, asserting that it is a manufacturer and entitled to purchase the materials at wholesale under RCW 82.04.050(1)(a)(iii). In the alternative, the taxpayer asserts that its purchases of materials used to produce prototypes are exempt from tax under the [M&E] exemption, RCW 82.08.02565, because it purchased the materials as a processor for hire and agent of its manufacturer clients. The taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
