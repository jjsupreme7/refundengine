  "summary": "A building contractor disputes retail sales tax and B&O tax assessed on permit fees and other charges from a city, which it contends were excludable as reimbursements from the landowner. Because the taxpayer was liable to pay the city, other than as agent, the charges were not excludable. We deny the petition.",
