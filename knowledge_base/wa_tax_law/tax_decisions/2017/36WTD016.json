  "summary": "A company, engaged in the manufacture and installation of custom casework, seeks reconsideration of a decision that use tax was due on value of cabinets installed rather than on the cost of component materials. We affirm our decision that, because the company was the \u201cconsumer\u201d of the materials it manufactured for installation under RCW 82.04.190(6), it owed use tax on the value of the cabinets under RCW 82.12.010(1)(a) and WAC 458-20-17001(7)-(9) rather than just on value of the component parts. We sustain the assessment as issued and deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
