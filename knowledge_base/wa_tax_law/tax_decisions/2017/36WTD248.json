  "summary": "A provider of services associated with \u201csupply chain management\u201d protests a tax assessment of use tax and/or deferred sales tax on the purchase of certain consumable supplies on various grounds. Taxpayer further protests future reporting instructions requiring Taxpayer to refrain from reporting any of its gross income under the stevedoring and associated activities B&O tax classification, and to report its gross income on various other tax classifications instead. Taxpayer argues that it should be entitled to report under the stevedoring and associated B&O tax classification because Taxpayer\u2019s services occur within a foreign trade zone. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition on all counts.",
