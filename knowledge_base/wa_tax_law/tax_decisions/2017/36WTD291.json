  "summary": "A taxpayer that engages in custom construction and speculative construction, where its subcontractors and vendors maintained its reseller permit on file, did not pay retail sales tax on purchases related to its speculative construction projects. The Department assessed deferred retail sales tax on the speculative construction purchases and imposed a penalty for improper use of the reseller permit, under RCW 82.32.291. The taxpayer sought review of the penalty, asserting that it did not affirmatively provide its reseller permit in making the purchases; therefore, it did not improperly use its reseller permit and the penalty does not apply. The taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
