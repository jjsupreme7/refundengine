  "summary": "A berry wholesaler protests the assessment of wholesaling B&O tax, interest, and resulting penalties on its Washington sales. We conclude that the Department\u2019s assessment was proper because the taxpayer\u2019s customers received taxpayer\u2019s goods in Washington. We also conclude that the Department was not bound by a previous letter ruling because the facts upon which the letter ruling was based did not reflect Taxpayer\u2019s actual business practices. Finally, we find that the Department was not barred by the statute of limitations because Taxpayer was an unregistered business. Taxpayer\u2019s petition for correction of assessment is denied.",
