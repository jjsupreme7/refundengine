  "summary": "A Washington manufacturer disputes B&O tax assessed on receipts from patent licenses, payroll receipts for employees who worked for affiliates, and use/deferred sales tax assessed on building improvements for a building that was used to transfer fuel to rail cars and later used to blend fuel. Because receipts from the patents were not casual or isolated, they were subject to B&O tax. Through its employees, the manufacturer provided services to the affiliates and was subject to tax on the affiliates\u2019 payment for those services. The building improvements do not qualify for the M&E exemption. Petition denied, but remanded to reclassify licensing income",
