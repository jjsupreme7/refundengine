  "summary": "A company that claimed a fruit and vegetable manufacturer [B&O] tax exemption, but failed to timely submit the required annual tax incentive survey, seeks review of the denial of its request for an extension to file the survey. The basis for the company\u2019s Petition is that it experienced a significant departure of employees around the time of the due date for filing the survey due to a VSIP. We conclude that the significant loss of employees to a VSIP does not amount to circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer pursuant to WAC 458-20-228 (\u201cRule 228\u201d). Petition denied.",
