  "summary": "A limited liability company that owns a 38.14 percent interest in an apartment complex protests the assessment of REET on 38.14 percent of the assessed value of that apartment complex as a result of Taxpayer\u2019s two members selling their combined one hundred percent interest in Taxpayer to a third party. Taxpayer argues that the amount of consideration that the third party paid for the one hundred percent interest in Taxpayer should be treated as the true and fair value of the 38.14 percent interest that Taxpayer owns in the apartment complex. We deny the petition.",
