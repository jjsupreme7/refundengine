  "summary": "A company that blends and sells biodiesel fuels petitions for correction of the assessment of tax on the sale of renewable energy identification numbers, asserting that they should be exempt from tax under RCW 82.04.4334 . . . or alternatively, asserts that tax on all sales for prior periods is precluded by a 2006 letter ruling. The Taxpayer also asserts that the audit exceeded the statute [limiting the time for assessments] due to use of a calendar year rather than the Taxpayer\u2019s fiscal year, which ends in September. We conclude that the letter ruling did not specifically address the sale of renewable energy identification numbers or equipment used in processing, and therefore, does not preclude taxation. We also conclude that the deduction from retail sales tax for the sales of biofuels, provided by 82.04.4334, does not apply to the sales of renewable energy identification numbers. . . . Finally, we note that the Taxpayer had not requested or received permission to report on a fiscal year, and accordingly, the calendar year audit was proper and authorized. We sustain the assessments and deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petitions.",
