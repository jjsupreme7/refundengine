  "summary": "A business that made purchases under the Rural County Investment Project Tax Deferral under RCW 82.60.070, but never finished the investment project, appeals assessments of use tax/deferred retail sales tax, interest, and penalties. The business asserts the . . . purchases of machinery and equipment [that initially] qualified for the M&E exemption in RCW 82.08.02565 and 82.12.02565, are subject to use tax measured by the items\u2019 values once such items failed to qualify for the exemption. If liable for deferred retail sales tax, Taxpayer argues that WAC 458-20-24001A(108)(b)(i) requires a waiver of interest and penalties. Petition denied in part and granted in part.",
