  "summary": "Taxpayer sold an office building and paid REET on the total consideration paid. Taxpayer now petitions for a partial refund of the REET, claiming that the amount it paid exceeded the property\u2019s \u201ctrue and fair value.\u201d We conclude that Taxpayer\u2019s initial REET Refund Request was timely filed, but that it failed to rebut the presumption that the total consideration actually paid was the property\u2019s true and fair value. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
