  "summary": "An importer of motor vehicles manufactured in Asia protests the assessment of wholesaling B&O tax on the sale of vehicles it asserts were in the process of import transportation until received by the buyers in Washington. Taxpayer asserts that all activities undertaken at other United States ports outside Washington where the vehicles are unloaded from a ship are related to shipping needs, which does not interrupt import transportation. We conclude the processing and handling involves a business purpose, rather than a direct shipping need, and thus results in a break in import transportation. We affirm the vehicles are subject to wholesaling tax.",
