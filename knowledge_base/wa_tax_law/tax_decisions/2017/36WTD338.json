  "summary": "Taxpayer, a supplier of telecommunications equipment, protests the assessment of wholesaling B&O tax. Taxpayer claims that the Department failed to properly deduct income from wholesale transactions of sales performed outside of Washington, and that it is entitled to deduct certain discounts from its taxable sales income. We conclude that the taxpayer has failed to provide adequate documentation of its claims that its Washington sales are overstated, and further conclude that the discounts it seeks are not bona fide and are not deductible. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied and the assessment is upheld.",
