  "summary": "The operator of a motel disputes the disallowance of its claimed partial exemption from retailing B&O tax and retail sales tax for gross income that Taxpayer claims it received from \u201cnontransient\u201d tenants. Taxpayer also claims that it does not owe TPA charges for certain transactions. Based on additional records provided by Taxpayer, we remand the assessment for possible adjustment of the retailing B&O and retail sales tax assessed on room rentals. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition with regard to collected and unremitted TPA charges.",
