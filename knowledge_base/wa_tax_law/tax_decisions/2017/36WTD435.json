  "summary": "A computer sales and repair shop petitions for correction of an assessment of retail sales and B&O tax, contending that it properly paid tax on amounts net of the retail sales tax collected from its customers because its prices were advertised as \u201ctax included.\u201d The weight of the evidence supports Taxpayer\u2019s position that all sales were advertised as tax-included. Accordingly, Taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted.",
