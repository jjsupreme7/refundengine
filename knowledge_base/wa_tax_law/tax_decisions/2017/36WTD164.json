  "summary": "A business that sells savory pies, sausage rolls, and sweet pastries, objects to assessment of retail sales tax on sales of those items, contending they are tax-exempt bakery items, and argues that the Department improperly disallowed an exempt food tax deduction. The business further argues that it is entitled to relief because it allegedly relied to its detriment on a Special Notice issued by the Department. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted in part and denied in part. We remand to Audit for possible adjustment.",
