  "summary": "A trucking company objects to the assessment of retail sales tax on (1) lease payments it made to related companies that exceeded the equipments\u2019 purchase price, and (2) the denial of the interstate/foreign deduction from PUT on hauls it made of imported goods between Washington ports and Washington destinations. It further asserts that the Department is [precluded] from assessing these taxes because the Audit did not assert them in prior audits. The assessment is sustained.",
