  "summary": "A nonprofit physicians association protests a tax assessment that disallowed deduction of a portion of their dues under RCW 82.04.4282. We hold that the portion of the dues received for the value of significant services rendered to its members through its Coordinated Quality Improvement Program is disqualified from the bona fide dues deduction. We affirm the assessment.",
