  "summary": "A grocery store with pharmacies in a number of its retail stores, that made sales of prescription drugs, seeks a refund of retailing B&O tax paid on these sales asserting that this tax is a prohibited indirect tax on the insurance carriers participating in the FEHBA, Medicare Advantage, and TRICARE, federal health insurance programs, from whom it received payment. We conclude that the B&O tax is not preempted and affirm the denial of the request for refund.",
