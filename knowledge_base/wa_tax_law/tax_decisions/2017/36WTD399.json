  "summary": "An LLC that owns real property in Washington protests the assessment of REET on the transfer by one of its two members of a fifty-percent interest in Taxpayer to the other member. Taxpayer argues that the Department\u2019s Special Programs Division used an incorrect amount as the \u201cselling price\u201d of the fifty-percent interest, and also should have assessed REET proportional to the interest percentage transferred. We grant in part and deny in part Taxpayer\u2019s petition, and remand to Special Programs.",
