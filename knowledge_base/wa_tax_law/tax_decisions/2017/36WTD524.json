  "summary": "Two affiliated Washington state auto dealerships located in . . . County and . . . County, respectively, petition for adjustment of their assessments as follows: 1) both dealerships dispute the assessment of use tax and/or deferred sales tax on certain \u201cservice kits\u201d they purchased, arguing that the purchase price of the kits can be bifurcated between retail and wholesale components and should not be taxed as bundled transactions; [and] 2) both dealerships dispute the assessment of use tax and/or deferred sales tax on car wash services they purchased, arguing that the purchases were for resale. . . . We grant the petitions as to the issue of the service kits and remand to the Audit Division, and deny the petitions as to the remaining issue.",
