  "summary": "An equipment financing company seeks review of an assessment of retail sales tax on leases and sales of equipment and vehicles . . . . First, the company claims that third-party loan servicers collected and remitted the applicable retail sales tax on equipment leases. Second, the company claims that although it did not collect retail sales tax when selling used vehicles at auction, purchasers of the used vehicles should have paid use tax when registering the vehicles with other state agencies. . . . The petition is denied in part, granted in part, and remanded for adjustment based on records provided.",
