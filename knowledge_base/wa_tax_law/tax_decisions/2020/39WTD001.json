  "summary": "Taxpayer, a subsidiary of a specialty retailer, protests the denial of its application to the Voluntary Disclosure Program because an affiliated entity doing business in Washington was being audited by the Department. The Taxpayer disputes that the audit of an affiliated entity constitutes a prohibited contact for purposes of the Voluntary Disclosure Program. We hold that because there was contact with an affiliated entity, the Taxpayer did not meet the requirements to participate in the Voluntary Disclosure Program. The Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
