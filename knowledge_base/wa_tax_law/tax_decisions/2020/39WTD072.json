  "summary": "An employer of record disputes the assessment of service and other activities B&O tax on amounts received from affiliates to compensate for the employer of record\u2019s payment of the affiliates\u2019 employee expenses. The employer of record asserts it qualifies as a paymaster and such amounts are excluded from gross income under WAC 458-20-111 and RCW 82.04.43393. Alternatively, should we find these payments are included in gross income, the employer of record asserts these payments should be sourced to the locations of the affiliates\u2019 properties being managed by the employees and apportioned outside Washington. Petition denied.",
