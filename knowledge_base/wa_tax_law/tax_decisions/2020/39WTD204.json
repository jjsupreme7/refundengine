  "summary": "A retailer protests the denial of its application for remittance of retail sales tax paid in connection with purchases of material-handling and racking equipment for use in its Washington warehousing facility. The retailer argues that its facility constitutes a distribution center for purposes of RCW 82.08.820 and amounts spent to purchase materials for use in the facility are qualifying purchases for purposes of the exemption set forth in that provision. We deny the petition.",
