  "date": "03/25/2020",
  "summary": "Taxpayers appeal the Department\u2019s disallowance of a credit adjustment to sales for retail sales tax remitted. Taxpayers argue that the Department erred in assessing retail sales tax on food sales without backing out an amount equal to the retail sales tax that was separately stated in receipts and collected on food sales. Taxpayers also argue that retail sales tax was included in the price of alcoholic beverages. We deny the petition.",
