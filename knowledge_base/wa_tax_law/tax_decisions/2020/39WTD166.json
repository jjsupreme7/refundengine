  "summary": "A LLC protests the Department\u2019s rescission of the company\u2019s High Unemployment County Sales and Use Tax Deferral certificate because the company did not construct the qualified building included in the approved application. Taxpayer argues that its failure to construct the qualified building should not be a basis for rescinding the deferral because its abandonment of construction of the qualified building was due to an unforeseeable condition. We deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
