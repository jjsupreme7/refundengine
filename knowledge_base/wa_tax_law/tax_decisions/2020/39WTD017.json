  "summary": "The sole principal and managing member of a used car dealer petitions for correction of a TFAA on grounds that (1) the assessments against the used car dealer do not show a failure to remit trust funds, and (2) the 50% evasion penalty is inapplicable because there is no showing that Taxpayer himself evaded payment. We deny the petition.",
