  "summary": "A person who transferred a 50% interest in property that he recently purchased at auction and remitted REET based on the sales price protests the assessment of additional tax based on the higher value for the property recorded on the county assessor\u2019s rolls. The Special Programs Division asserted that the transfer was not an arm\u2019s length transaction; however, no evidence has been presented [by the Special Programs Division,] that the sales price (which was based on half of the auction price) did not establish the fair market value of the property at the time of transfer or that there was any relationship or agreement between the parties that would support characterizing the subsequent transfer as anything other than an arm\u2019s length transaction. We find that tax was remitted based on the most recent selling price for the property and grant the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
