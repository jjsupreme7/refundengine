  "summary": "An out of state corporation engaging in online sales to customers in Washington State through a third-party online marketplace facilitation service disputes assessments by the Department based on lack of substantial nexus. Taxpayer contends it has no physical presence or inventory storage in Washington, and it has never maintained a stock of goods in Washington. Taxpayer argues that the digital assignment of third-party inventory located in Washington to Taxpayer by Facilitator\u2019s electronic inventory management system, for purpose of Facilitator\u2019s delivery of orders to Taxpayer\u2019s Washington customers, does not provide sufficient basis for substantial nexus with Washington. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
