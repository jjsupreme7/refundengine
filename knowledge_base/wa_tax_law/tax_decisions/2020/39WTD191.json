  "summary": "An out-of-state video game development company protests a tax assessment in which it was assessed retailing B&O tax and retail sales tax. Taxpayer argued that it was not subject to taxation in Washington because its only in-state activity, participation at an annual three-day trade show in [Washington], did not create substantial nexus with Washington. We deny the petition.",
