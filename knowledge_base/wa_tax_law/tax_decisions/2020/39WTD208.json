  "summary": "A Washington corporation seeks cancellation of an assessment of REET imposed as the result of its sale of a business. Taxpayer objects to the Department\u2019s use of the county market value property tax assessment as the selling price of the real property after Taxpayer provided an asset allocation made under IRC \u00a7 1060. Taxpayer asserts that the value determined under its IRC \u00a7 1060 asset allocation represents the true and fair value of the real property for the purpose of calculating REET, and therefore the Department is precluded from using the county market value property tax assessment for this purpose. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
