  "summary": "The sole member of a now-defunct construction company petitions for the correction of TFAA . . . . During the company\u2019s life, it collected retail sales tax from its customers, but failed to remit the taxes to the Department. Prior to the company\u2019s dissolution, the Department issued four tax warrants. . . . [W]hen the company was dissolved, the Department pursued the member personally for the outstanding balances pursuant to RCW 82.32.145. The member argues that the company was unable to pay its tax debt due to financial hardship caused by its customers failing to pay for work the company performed. Petition denied.",
