  "summary": "Taxpayer protests the Department\u2019s assessment which included adjustments due to disallowed deductions. Taxpayer took deductions for sales of marijuana products exempt from taxation under RCW 82.08.9998, which exempts from retail sales tax sales of marijuana products to persons with recognition cards. Although Taxpayer did not keep copies of recognition cards, Taxpayer asserts it met the recordkeeping requirements of RCW 69.50.375(3)(e) and WAC 314-55-080 and argues the Department\u2019s requirement to keep a copy of each buyer\u2019s recognition card contravenes the statute and rule. RCW 69.50.375 and WAC 314-55-080 set forth the requirements a licensed marijuana retailer must comply with to be issued a medical marijuana endorsement, not the Department\u2019s recordkeeping requirements for the tax exemption under RCW 82.08.9998. We deny the petition.",
