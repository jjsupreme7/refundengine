  "summary": "A used automobile dealership disputes the Department\u2019s decision to not accept its amended tax returns for the January through July, September, and October 2019, periods, which include a lesser retail sales tax and B&O tax liability than that initially reported. Taxpayer asserts that its amended returns correct its gross income and bad debt deductions for the covered periods because it asserts it qualifies for additional bad debt deductions due to vehicle repossessions that it did not previously claim. Taxpayer has not provided suitable records to support its amended returns and demonstrate that it qualifies for the additional deductions. We deny the petition.",
