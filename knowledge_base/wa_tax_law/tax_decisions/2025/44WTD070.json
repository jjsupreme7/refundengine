  "summary": "A taxpayer that operates a television station that is licensed and regulated by the FCC distributes content through over-the-air broadcasts and via retransmission by third-party MVPDs, such as cable operators and direct-to-home broadcast satellite providers. The taxpayer asserts that it engages in television broadcasting with regard to its retransmission to MVPDs, including its own locally-produced content, and is eligible for the preferential B&O tax rate available for radio and television broadcasting. We deny the petition.",
