  "summary": "A business that provides insurance companies with water mitigation services via local service providers (Taxpayer) petitions for correction of assessments on grounds that Taxpayer provides insurance claims management to out-of-state insurers rather than providing retail construction services through subcontracts to insureds and lacks nexus with Washington. Taxpayer also protests the measure of its gross income as total proceeds from payments made by an insurer rather than merely fees earned. We deny the petition.",
