  "summary": "A plat development company protests the inclusion of an evasion penalty for failure to timely remit collected retail sales tax, attributing the failure to lack of familiarity with the invoicing system. We sustain the inclusion of the evasion penalty as ongoing and consistent underreporting of collected retail sales tax and willful alteration of the electronic records is a sufficient basis to support the imposition of the evasion penalty.",
