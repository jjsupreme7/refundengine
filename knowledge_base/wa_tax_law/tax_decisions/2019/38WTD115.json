  "summary": "A financial institution that receives income from subservicing mortgage loans petitions for correction of an assessment that apportioned its loan servicing income based on the location of the borrower. Taxpayer maintained that the subservicing income should be attributed to where the services are performed. We conclude that Taxpayer\u2019s loan servicing income should be apportioned based on the location of the borrower as provided in WAC 458-20-19404[A]. The assessment is sustained.",
