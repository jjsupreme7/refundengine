  "summary": "A medical marijuana management company protests the Department\u2019s assessment of retail sales tax and retailing B&O tax arguing that it is a management company providing management services to a collective garden only, and that neither party is making retail sales. It also argues that even if it is making retail sales, those sales are exempt either as sales of drugs pursuant to a prescription or sales of medicines of a botanical origin. We deny the petition.",
