  "summary": "A Washington State corporation engaged in log hauling to destinations in and out of Washington seeks reconsideration of Determination No. 18-0018, which held that Taxpayer was not eligible for claimed deductions to gross income for hauling logs to export yards taxable under the Log Hauling Over Public Highways PUT classification. During the audit, the Department\u2019s auditor reportedly told Taxpayer if it obtained an export facility exemption certificate from qualifying export yards, then hauls made to those yards might qualify for the deduction. Taxpayer obtained the certificate from one export yard covering March 2016, and on that basis sought refund of tax assessed on all hauls covered by the certificate. Taxpayer\u2019s petition for reconsideration is denied.",
