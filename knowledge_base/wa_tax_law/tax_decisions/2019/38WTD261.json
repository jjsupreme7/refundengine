  "summary": "A Washington-based aerospace manufacturing business argues that it has shown that certain activities qualify for the B&O tax classification applicable to manufacturers or sellers of commercial airplane components manufactured by the seller. We remand the petition for an adjustment based upon Taxpayer\u2019s timely submission of proof to the operating division which substantiates its qualification for the aerospace manufacturing B&O tax rate on the disputed transactions, consistent with the holding in this determination.",
