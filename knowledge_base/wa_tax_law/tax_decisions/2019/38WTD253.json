  "summary": "A restaurant business seeks review of an assessment of retail sales tax, retailing B&O tax, and evasion penalty. The taxpayer asserts that unreported sales were unreasonably estimated and the Department has not established the requirements for the imposition of the evasion penalty. The Department holds that the taxpayer failed to maintain suitable records and that the Audit Division reasonably estimated unreported sales and tax liability. The Department also holds that clear, cogent and convincing evidence established that the taxpayer intentionally evaded payment of tax and required imposition of the evasion penalty. The Department denied the taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
