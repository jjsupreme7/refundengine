  "summary": "A buffet restaurant disputes assessments of tax and penalties resulting from an estimate of cash sales. The restaurant asserts that the Department erred in estimating the percentage of cash sales by observing customer payments and calculating an average percentage of the frequency at which customers paid in cash, instead of selecting an industry average percentage. The restaurant also asserts the Department has not shown that it intended to evade paying taxes. Petition denied.",
