  "summary": "A seller of cleaning and maintenance products at retail and wholesale protests a tax assessment based on unreported sales. Taxpayer argues that the amounts at issue were the result of price adjustments that either (1) did not constitute part of Taxpayer\u2019s gross proceeds of sale, or (2) constituted bona fide discounts that are deductible from Taxpayer\u2019s taxable income. We deny the petition.",
