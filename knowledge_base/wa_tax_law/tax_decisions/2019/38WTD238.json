  "summary": "A retailer selling roll-your-own cigarettes protests estimated assessments of tax on untaxed roll-your-own cigarette sales. The Taxpayer was provided the opportunity to provide records and detail to substantiate actual sales, but no records were received. We therefore sustain the assessments as issued and deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
