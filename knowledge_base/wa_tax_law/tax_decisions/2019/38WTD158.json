  "summary": "A national title insurer protests the Department\u2019s assessment of retail sales tax, retailing B&O tax, and service and other activities B&O tax. Taxpayer argues that the Department overstated its income by erroneously (1) using insurance premium reporting documents to estimate Taxpayer\u2019s income, and (2) using an estimated percentage to calculate its income from certain sales. We deny the petition in part, grant it in part, and remand it for additional records.",
