  "summary": "A provider of software and data hosting services, in conjunction with help desk and other IT support services, protested an assessment of retail sales tax on its receipts from these services. The taxpayer asserted that the transaction meets the definition of a \u201cbundled transaction,\u201d [and] should be taxed as a non-retail service under statutory exclusions in RCW 82.08.190(4). The Department concludes that the software and data hosting services are retail DAS under RCW 82.04.050(8)(a) and that the IT support services provided exclusively in connection with the software and data hosting DAS were included in the retail sale of DAS under RCW 82.04.050(8)(b). The Department denies the taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
