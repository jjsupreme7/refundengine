  "summary": "A residential and commercial solid waste collection service company petitions for review of the denial of its application for CAFCV tax credits. The Department denied its application after concluding that the company failed to submit the final documentation required to qualify for the credit within fifteen days of receiving the vehicles included in its application as required by statute. The company asserts that the Department should accept its application because it submitted the final documentation within fifteen business days from receiving the vehicles . . . . We deny the petition.",
