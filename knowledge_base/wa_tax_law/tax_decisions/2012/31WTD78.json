  "summary": "A daughter, who quitclaimed mortgaged real property to her father who paid off the mortgages with a reverse mortgage, protests the assessment of real estate excise tax on the transfer, arguing the transfer qualifies for the gift exemption in WAC 458- 61A-201. We conclude the transfer was a sale, not a gift, and deny the petition.",
