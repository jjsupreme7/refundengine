  "summary": "A company that provides logging services for timber harvesters, and occasionally logs some of its own timber, objects to the Department of Revenue\u2019s assessment of deferred retail sales and/or use tax on a feller buncher it uses in its logging operations to cut and bunch trees, arguing that the feller buncher is used to primarily to sort cut trees and forward them. We deny the taxpayer\u2019s petition, and find taxpayer\u2019s purchase and use of the feller buncher is not exempt from deferred retail sales and/or use tax under the machinery and equipment (M&E) exemption.",
