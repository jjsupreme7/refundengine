  "summary": "Taxpayer appeals a ruling that Real Estate Excise Tax (REET) applies to transfers or conveyances of real property in circumstances where a receiver is appointed by the superior court in a judicial foreclosure.  We grant taxpayer\u2019s petition and hold that the appointment of a receiver does not change the nature of a judicial foreclosure and that the transfer or conveyance of real property in such a circumstance is still effectuated by an order of sale by the court. Because transfers or conveyances made pursuant to an order of sale by a court in a lien foreclosure proceeding do not fit within the statutory definition of a \u201csale\u201d of real property, the transfer at issue herein is not subject to REET.",
