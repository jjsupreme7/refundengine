  "summary": "An out-of-state seller of food products protests an assessment of B&O tax and retail sales tax, arguing that two visits to an international wholesale buyer during the last five years to promote sales of its product shipped from outside Washington through buyer\u2019s location in another state to overseas locations do not establish nexus in Washington. We agree. Accordingly, Taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted.",
