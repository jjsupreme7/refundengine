  "summary": "An out-of-state limited liability company that leased railroad cars protests the retail sales tax and retailing business and occupation tax assessment on its income from leasing its railroad cars to private companies that\u00a0used them to transport their own goods. The leasing company argues that its income is not subject to Washington taxes because its customers received the railroad cars outside of Washington. We grant in part and deny in part the petition.",
