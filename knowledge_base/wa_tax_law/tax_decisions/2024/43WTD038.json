  "summary": "Sellers of digital signature and document workflow services (\u201cTaxpayers\u201d) protest the reclassification of receipts for telephone support and training and seminars from the wholesaling business and occupation (B&O) tax classification to the retailing B&O tax classification, and the assessment of retail sales tax, on grounds that these receipts are for services not subject to retailing B&O tax and retail sales tax. Taxpayers also assert that the Department incorrectly assessed retail sales tax on sales to customers exempt from retail sales tax, and that the measure of taxes erroneously includes receipts for out-of-state seminar sponsorship. Taxpayers\u2019 petition is denied in part and granted in part. We deny the petition with respect to Taxpayers\u2019 claim that receipts for telephone support and training and seminars are not subject to retailing B&O tax and retail sales tax. We grant the petition to the extent Taxpayers have provided records showing that retail sales tax was assessed on sales to customers exempt from retail sales tax and taxes were assessed on receipts from seminar sponsorship not subject to Washington taxes. We remand this matter to the Audit Division for adjustment.",
