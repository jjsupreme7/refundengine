  "summary": "A Taxpayer\u2019s erroneous belief that the OTP tax was the responsibility of the seller of the product and lack of knowledge about the taxes applicable to the sale of these products does not excuse liability for the OTP tax.A Taxpayer\u2019s mistake about the due date resulted in initiating a payment on the day after the actual due date. This late payment was the result of a misunderstanding or lack of knowledge, which is expressly defined as a circumstance that is not considered to be beyond the control of a taxpayer and so will not support a waiver of penalties.",
