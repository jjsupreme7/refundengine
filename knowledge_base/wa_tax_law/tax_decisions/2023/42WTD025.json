  "summary": "An audio equipment rental company protests the Department\u2019s disallowance of a retail sales tax exemption the company claimed in relation to its rentals of audio equipment to artistic or cultural organizations. The subject exemption applies only to qualified buyers on sales of certain objects, and the Department determined that the company provides a service\u2013not a rental of an object\u2013when an operator accompanies the rented equipment. We conclude that the company is not entitled to the exemption on rentals of audio equipment that include an operator, but is entitled to the exemption on rentals of bare equipment. The company also argues that it is not liable for retail sales tax it failed to collect on non-qualifying equipment rentals if it accepted a certification of tax-exempt status from the buyer. We agree with the company on this second issue. We deny the petition in part and grant it in part, and remand the matter to the operating division for adjustment subject to verification of the exemption certificates the company provided.",
