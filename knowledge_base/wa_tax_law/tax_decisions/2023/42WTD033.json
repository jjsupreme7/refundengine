  "summary": ". . . (\u201cTaxpayer\u201d) protests the Department\u2019s imposition of REET on the fair market value of real property according to the county tax roll instead of the value assigned by Taxpayer. We find that the Department\u2019s Audit Division (\u201cAudit\u201d) correctly valued the transfer using the property\u2019s value as recorded on . . . County property tax rolls. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
