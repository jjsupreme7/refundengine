  "summary": "A restaurant disputes an estimated percentage of cash sales (and the resulting tax assessment) and an assessment of the evasion penalty. The restaurant asserts that the Department erred in estimating based on multiple observations of cash and credit or debit card sales entered into the point-of-sale system and should have based its estimate on industry averages. The restaurant also asserts the Department has not shown that it intended to evade paying taxes. Petition denied.",
