  "summary": "An out-of-state corporation engaged in the buying and selling of . . . [tangible personal property] (Taxpayer) contests the imposition of wholesaling B&O tax on certain amounts it processed on behalf of others. Taxpayer asserts that in certain transactions it acted as purchasing agent for third-party sales between outside manufacturers and member purchasers. Taxpayer argues that, as a matter of law, it was neither a purchaser nor reseller in those transactions, that it was therefore not engaging in wholesaling, and it should be charged service and other activities B&O tax on the fees charged for its purchase agent service, not wholesaling B&O tax on the sale price. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
