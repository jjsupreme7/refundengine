  "summary": "A company that acts as a pharmacy benefit manager disputes the inclusion of certain items in gross income of the business and the resulting assessment of service and other activities B&O tax, along with the assessment of annual reconciliation penalties. The company asserts that payments received from customers\u2014intended to cover certain payments the company made to pharmacies on behalf of the customers\u2014are either not included in gross income of the business or excluded from gross income of the business as an advance or reimbursement. The company also asserts that certain rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers constitute bona fide discounts that reduce the company\u2019s gross income of the business, and that an annual reconciliation penalty was erroneously assessed because the company did not apportion its gross income during the period at issue. We deny the petition.",
