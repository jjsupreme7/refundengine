  "summary": "A company distributing [tangible personal property], disputes tax assessments covering a period when it was a subsidiary of a national [retailer] and a subsequent period after it merged into its parent entity. The company disputes the sufficiency of taxing nexus for pre-merger periods and disputes the taxation of internal transfers for post-merger periods. Additionally, the company asserts that a number of wholesale sales were improperly classified as retail sales. We find that the company established substantial nexus for pre-merger periods based on its relationship with and use of its parent company\u2019s Washington retail locations. We also find that the company has not provided sufficient records to characterize disputed transactions as wholesale sales, and we sustain these portions of the assessments. However, for post-merger periods we conclude that the company ceased to exist as a separate legal entity and became part of the parent entity and, therefore, there was no longer a basis to tax accounting entries as if they were still taxable intercompany transfers. The Taxpayer\u2019s petitions are granted in part and denied in part.",
