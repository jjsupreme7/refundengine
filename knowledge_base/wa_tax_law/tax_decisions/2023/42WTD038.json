  "summary": "A Washington construction company seeks a refund of amounts it paid towards an assessment of B&O tax and use tax following two partial audits. The Department assessed the subject B&O tax because it found the company reported certain income under the wrong tax classification and failed to report other income. The Department assessed the use tax on the estimated value of materials the company installed on public road construction and government contracting jobs because the company did not provide documentation showing that the materials were previously subject to retail sales tax. We conclude that the company has failed to provide suitable documentation to support its argument that the B&O and use tax assessments should be adjusted and, therefore, there is no basis for granting the refund the company seeks. Petition denied.",
