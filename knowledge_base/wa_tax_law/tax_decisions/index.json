We also find that the company has not provided sufficient records to characterize disputed transactions as wholesale sales, and we sustain these portions of the assessments. However, for post-merger periods we conclude that the company ceased to exist as a separate legal entity and became part of the parent entity and, therefore, there was no longer a basis to tax accounting entries as if they were still taxable intercompany transfers.

The subject exemption applies only to qualified buyers on sales of certain objects, and the Department determined that the company provides a service\u2013not a rental of an object\u2013when an operator accompanies the rented equipment. We conclude that the company is not entitled to the exemption on rentals of audio equipment that include an operator, but is entitled to the exemption on rentals of bare equipment. The company also argues that it is not liable for retail sales tax it failed to collect on non-qualifying equipment rentals if it accepted a certification of tax-exempt status from the buyer. We agree with the company on this second issue. We deny the petition in part and grant it in part, and remand the matter to the operating division for adjustment subject to verification of the exemption certificates the company provided.",

The Department assessed the subject B&O tax because it found the company reported certain income under the wrong tax classification and failed to report other income. The Department assessed the use tax on the estimated value of materials the company installed on public road construction and government contracting jobs because the company did not provide documentation showing that the materials were previously subject to retail sales tax. We conclude that the company has failed to provide suitable documentation to support its argument that the B&O and use tax assessments should be adjusted and, therefore, there is no basis for granting the refund the company seeks.

The company asserts that any offsets should be limited to the type of tax at issue in the refund and by the nonclaim period that would apply to the assessment of the taxes used for the offset. We find that there is no basis to limit the offsets to the specific type of tax at issue in the refund request. As to the offset, because the provisions of WAC 458-20-229 specifically anticipate the review of new information to reduce a refund claim, we find the offset at issue was proper. The Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",

In regards to the first assessment, Taxpayer asserts that it did not have sufficient nexus with the state of Washington to subject it to the B&O tax prior to the state\u2019s adoption of economic nexus. Alternatively, it asserts that the auditor\u2019s use of a single factor apportionment formula as opposed to a three factor formula for this period was in error. Finally, Taxpayer argues that the assessment of penalties is inequitable because the Department itself did not believe that sufficient nexus existed to tax the activities of credit card companies prior to the adoption of economic nexus. In regards to the second assessment, Taxpayer argues that the Department\u2019s failure to provide it with guidance regarding the proper treatment of cashback bonuses was a circumstance beyond its control that caused its underpayment of tax. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s position as it relates to nexus and the assessment of penalties. However, we grant it as it relates to the apportionment formula.",

We grant taxpayer\u2019s petition and hold that the appointment of a receiver does not change the nature of a judicial foreclosure and that the transfer or conveyance of real property in such a circumstance is still effectuated by an order of sale by the court.
