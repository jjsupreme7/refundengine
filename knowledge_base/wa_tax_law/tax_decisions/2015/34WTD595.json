  "summary": "A Washington company that provides communication services, and designs voice and data networks, appeals a penalty for misuse of its reseller permit. Some of the company\u2019s vendors delivered products to the company at out-of-state locations, and did not charge the company sales tax, while others did not charge sales tax after they obtained the company\u2019s reseller permit. We uphold the penalty assessed on sales of deliveries into Washington from vendors that may have obtained the company\u2019s reseller permit. However, the penalty was not applicable to products the company picked up at out-of-state locations, and later brought into Washington. We grant the petition in part, deny it in part, and remand the assessment for adjustment.",
