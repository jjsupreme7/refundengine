  "summary": "An out-of-state student loan servicer (Taxpayer) appeals a tax assessment, contending that because it has no physical presence and does not solicit business to establish a market in Washington, it has no nexus with Washington. Taxpayer further contends that the income it received from loan lenders for \u201cservicing\u201d loans cannot constitute \u201creceipts\u201d from Washington. We conclude Taxpayer has adequate nexus with Washington under the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and that a portion of Taxpayer\u2019s income from lenders may constitute receipts attributable to Washington, thereby subjecting Taxpayer to taxation in Washington. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
