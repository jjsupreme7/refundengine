  "summary": "Taxpayer, the controller of a defunct corporation, appeals a trust fund accountability assessment (TFAA). Because we find that the Taxpayer held himself out to be and was acting in the capacity of a chief financial officer at the time a portion of the trust fund liability accrued, the assessment is sustained with respect to the unpaid sales taxes that accrued while Taxpayer was acting as chief financial officer. Taxpayer is not liable for the unpaid sales taxes that accrued after his position was terminated. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted in part and denied in part.",
