  "summary": "A limited liability company engaged in speculative building protests an Audit assessment of deferred sales and/or use tax on certain retail purchases. Taxpayer contends that certain purchases were exempt from retail sales tax because they were purchases either for the U.S. government or for public road construction.  Taxpayer also contends that certain amounts it paid for mosaic tile work were for design services, and therefore exempt from retail sales tax. We deny the petition.",
