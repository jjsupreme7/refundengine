  "summary": "An out-of-state web development company (Taxpayer) appeals a letter ruling finding that Taxpayer established nexus in Washington in 2013 because Taxpayer had payroll of more than $53,000 in Washington during that year. Taxpayer argues that a portion of the amount of payroll it paid in 2013 was attributable to 2012. Taxpayer also argues for a waiver of any tax liability because its payroll was only slightly above the $53,000 threshold. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
