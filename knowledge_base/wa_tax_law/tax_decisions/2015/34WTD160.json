  "summary": "Taxpayer, a natural pet food retailer, appeals an assessment of retail sales taxes it over-collected on sales of goods where its point-of-sale system mistakenly charged sales tax on the full retail price of goods sold to customers at a discount. Taxpayer also appeals retail sales tax assessed on manufacturer discounts that Taxpayer deducted from the retail sales price of goods it sold to its customers. Finally, Taxpayer protests the assessment on the grounds that the State of Washington receives a windfall by collecting over-collected sales taxes. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
