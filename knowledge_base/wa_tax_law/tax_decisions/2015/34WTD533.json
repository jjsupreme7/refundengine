  "summary": "A forest harvester protests timber tax assessed on the scaled volume of logs sold to a chipwood processor.  Because the buyer\u2019s facility was not an approved chipwood destination when the logs were delivered, the harvester could not pay the tax based on the weight of the wood. We deny the petition.",
