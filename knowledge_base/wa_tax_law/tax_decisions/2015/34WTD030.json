  "summary": "A contractor specializing in ceiling construction appeals an assessment of retail sales tax, retailing and wholesaling business and occupation (\u201cB&O\u201d) tax, penalties, and interest, on the basis that it worked as a sub-contractor on several jobs and has been unable to secure resale certificates and/or reseller permits because many general contractors have closed their businesses, monetary gifts from a relative were improperly assessed retailing B&O and retail sales tax, and it did its best in reporting and paying taxes. We deny the petition.",
