  "summary": "Two [out of state] nonprofit hospitals seek a refund of business and occupation (B&O) tax paid on . . . Medicaid payments and . . . Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for medical care provided in Washington. They also seek a refund of B&O tax on medical services that they provided to their employees covered by the hospitals\u2019 self-insurance plans. Because no exclusion applies to payments from . . . Medicaid and CHIP, and the medical services provided to the hospitals\u2019 employees were taxable activities, we deny their petitions.",
