  "summary": "The managing member of a now defunct restaurant and lounge protests a TFAA against her, stating that the amount assessed against the defunct business was in error. We conclude that Taxpayer is responsible for the LLC\u2019s collected and unremitted retail sales tax and may not challenge [the amount assessed against] the defunct business. Accordingly, we affirm the assessment.",
