  "summary": "Three community solar projects (CSPs) object to a ruling that they must register, report, and possibly pay business and occupation (B&O) tax on incentive payments they receive from public utility districts (PUDs). Because they are engaged in business, the CSPs must register and report the incentive payments as gross income subject to B&O tax. We deny the petitions.",
