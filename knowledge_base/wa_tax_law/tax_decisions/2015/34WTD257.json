  "summary": "Two affiliated limited liability companies, Taxpayer A and Taxpayer B, operate two restaurants. Taxpayers protest the retail sales tax and retailing business and occupation (B&O) tax assessed by the Department. Taxpayers contend that its records do not accurately reflect (1) the amount of retail sales tax actually collected from their customers and (2) the amount of Taxpayers\u2019 actual gross proceeds of sales. Taxpayers also contend that they are entitled to a larger cash and trade discount deduction than allowed by the Department. We [deny] Taxpayer A\u2019s petition. We deny Taxpayer B\u2019s petition.",
