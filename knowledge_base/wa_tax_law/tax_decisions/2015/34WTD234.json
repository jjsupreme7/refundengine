  "summary": "A contractor, engaged in the custom construction of concrete structures, walkways, and roads, challenges an assessment of retail sales tax, retailing business and occupation (B&O) tax on unreported income, and use tax and/or deferred sales tax on construction materials. Because the contractor has not provided records documenting its unreported income or receipts proving it paid retail sales tax on materials used in its public road construction jobs, we deny the petition.",
