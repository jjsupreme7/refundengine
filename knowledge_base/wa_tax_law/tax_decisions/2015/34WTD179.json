  "summary": "A limited liability company (LLC) that was assessed retail sales tax, business and occupation (B&O) tax, penalties, and interest, protests the assessment on the grounds that its current owners purchased the LLC from a prior owner during the audit period. The LLC\u2019s current owners claim that they should not be held accountable for periods when the LLC was owned by someone else. Because the LLC was engaged in business as a separate legal entity for the entire audit period, we hold that the change in ownership of the LLC is immaterial, and that the LLC owes the tax, penalties, and interest that it accrued through its business activities. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
