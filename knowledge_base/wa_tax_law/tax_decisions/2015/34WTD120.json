  "summary": "A software development company (Taxpayer) that serves certain customers in the aerospace industry protests the Audit Division\u2019s reclassification of its income from various classifications to the service and other activities business and occupation (B&O) tax classification. Taxpayer argues that its business activity is properly classified under one of the preferential tax rates offered for certain aerospace-related activities. Taxpayer further protests the Audit Division\u2019s assessment of use tax and/or deferred sales tax on certain purchases of computers, arguing that those purchases are exempt from retail sales tax and use tax under an aerospace-related exemption. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
