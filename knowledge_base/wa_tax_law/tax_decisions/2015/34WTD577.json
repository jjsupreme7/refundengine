  "summary": "The owner of a mobile home park protests the Department denial of a refund request based on the Department\u2019s finding that Taxpayer did not qualify as a \u201cfinancial business\u201d and, therefore, could not deduct from the measure of its tax liability certain amounts it received from interest on mortgage loans. Taxpayer argued that it was a \u201cfinancial business\u201d because it was the lender on such loans similar to other types of financial businesses. We deny the petition.",
