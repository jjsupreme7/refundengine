  "summary": "A Taxpayer, acting as a subcontractor on a federal government dock building contract, incorrectly used its reseller permit when making purchases of materials. As a result it did not pay any retail sales tax on this project, and it also did not subsequently pay any use tax. Because the Taxpayer\u2019s basis for requesting a waiver of the reseller permit misuse penalty was that it was unaware of its proper usage in this type of contract, there is no basis under RCW 82.32.291 for waiver of the penalty.",
