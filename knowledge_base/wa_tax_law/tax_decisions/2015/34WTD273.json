  "summary": "A non-profit, collective medical garden appeals a ruling that it must collect retail sales tax when it sells medical marijuana to patients who present written authorization from a health care professional that the patient may benefit from the medical use of cannabis. Because the authorization is not a prescription, the transfer of medical marijuana is not exempt from retail sales tax, and we deny the petition.",
