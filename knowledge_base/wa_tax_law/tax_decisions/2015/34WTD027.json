  "summary": "A construction company petitions for reconsideration of a determination affirming an assessment of tax for failing to report tax on outstanding invoices when it converted from cash to accrual method of accounting. The Taxpayer asserts tax was remitted on a number of the invoices at issue. Because the Taxpayer has not been able to substantiate tax was remitted on the invoices at issue, we sustain the assessment as issued and deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
