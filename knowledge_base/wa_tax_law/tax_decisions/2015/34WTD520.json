  "summary": "An individual grantor, who transferred Washington real estate to a grantee who agreed to pay $ . . . to the grantor\u2019s revocable trust secured by the property, protests REET assessed on the transfer. The grantor alleges that he was acting as trustee on behalf of the grantee, who was a beneficiary of the trust. Because the grantor could revoke the trust and receive the payments from the grantee under the deed of trust, the transfer was subject to REET measured by the amount due under the deed of trust.",
