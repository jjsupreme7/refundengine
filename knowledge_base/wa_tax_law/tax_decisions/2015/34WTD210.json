  "summary": "An out of state corporation that provides payroll and benefits services to a parent corporation, and that reported wages in this state as the employer of record, protests the assessment of B&O tax under the services classification on estimated income, arguing amounts received for payroll and benefits are excluded reimbursements under WAC 458-20-111 (Rule 111). Because the taxpayer did not prove it has solely agent liability to pay the employer obligations, we conclude the amounts received are not excludible reimbursements. The petition is denied.",
