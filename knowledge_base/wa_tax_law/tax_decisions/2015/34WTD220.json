  "summary": "An LLC owning real property appeals a Real Estate Excise Tax Assessment (REET) on a controlling interest transfer, asserting that assessed value of the property or the selling price of the interest represents the true and fair value of the property in light of a permanent conservation easement, which significantly limits the use of the property. As the assessed value of the property on the county tax rolls reflects the true and fair value of the land under RCW 84.34.060, we conclude this value should have been used. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted.",
