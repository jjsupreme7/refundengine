  "summary": "An out-of-state corporation (Taxpayer) that reported wages in Washington as the employer of record for film crews working in Washington protests the assessment of service and other activities business and occupation (B&O) tax on Taxpayer\u2019s full gross income, arguing that amounts it received for payroll and benefits from its Washington client are excludable reimbursements under WAC 458-20-111. Because Taxpayer failed to prove that it was not personally liable for the payment of payroll and benefits expenses associated with the film crews, we conclude those expenses were not excludable under WAC 458-20-111. The petition is denied.",
