  "summary": "A ship building company claimed improvements and repairs it made to a customer\u2019s vessel were exempt from retail sales tax on the basis that the taxpayer delivered the completed vessel to a nonresident purchaser at a point outside of Washington State. Because the taxpayer failed to meet its burden of proof to show it qualified for the exemption under RCW 82.08.0265, we uphold the assessment and deny taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
