  "summary": "A [taxpayer] appeals a tax ruling that its purchase of LOX for use in its wastewater treatment process is subject to retail sales tax. The [taxpayer] appealed the ruling, asserting that its ruling request did not contain sufficient facts regarding its use of LOX in the manufacture of a mulch-like biosolids product, and that its purchase of LOX for this purpose is exempt from retail sales tax, pursuant RCW 82.04.050(1)(a)(iii) and WAC 458-20-113 (Rule 113) because it is used in manufacturing a new product for sale and becomes an ingredient or component of the product. The taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted.",
