  "summary": "A company operating a restaurant protests an assessment estimating unreported cash sales, asserting that the records provided were sufficient and all sales were reported. We affirm the assessment because the Audit Division has established that business records were insufficient and reasonably exercised its authority to arrive at an estimate of cash sales. We deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
