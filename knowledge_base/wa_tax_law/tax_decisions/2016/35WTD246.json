  "summary": "An out-of-state company that provided marketing services for a Washington insurance company, protests additional B&O taxes assessed under the service and other activities classification when its deduction for marketing materials was disallowed. The company contends that its income should be taxed under the lower B&O tax rate for the activities of insurance producers or agents. Because the company provided marketing services for the insurer, rather than insurance services for the policy holders, its income was properly taxed under the service and other activities B&O tax classification. In the alternative, the company seeks to deduct payments to a foreign affiliate, under a transfer pricing agreement. We deny the petition.",
