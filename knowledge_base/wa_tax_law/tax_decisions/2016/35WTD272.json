  "summary": "[A husband and wife are the former members of a now defunct LLC. The wife protests a TFAA against her and the marital community of her and her husband, contending that she was not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the business, was not responsible during the disputed period for collecting and remitting retail sales taxes, and that she did not willfully fail to pay those taxes.] We conclude that the former member was not personally liable for the TFAA because she did not have control or supervision of the collected funds or the responsibility of filing returns or paying the taxes to the Department during the period at issue, but that her husband and the marital community are liable. We grant the petition in part and deny it in part.",
