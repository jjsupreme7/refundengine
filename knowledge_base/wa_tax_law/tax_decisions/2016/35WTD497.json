  "summary": "A speculative and custom builder protests the assessment of the reseller permit misuse penalty with regard to items purchased for consumption by the business, arguing that it was not aware that it improperly used its permit. Taxpayer also asserts that its lack of knowledge of its retail sales tax liability and the serious illness of Taxpayer\u2019s member\u2019s family are circumstances beyond Taxpayer\u2019s control for waiver of penalties and interest. We deny the petition.",
