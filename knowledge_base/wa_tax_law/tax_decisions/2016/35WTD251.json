  "date": "05/31/2016",
  "summary": "A flooring company disputes the assessment of retail sales tax arguing that the Department erred when calculating tax liability, and further, contests the assessment of a misuse of reseller permit penalty on certain purchases from Washington State businesses contending that it made the purchases as a subcontractor or government contractor, and therefore, did not owe retail sales tax. Taxpayer also requests the waiver of interest and a late-payment of return penalty on the grounds that they are excessive and unnecessary. We conclude that the business has not shown that the Department erred when calculating and assessing retail sales tax or when the Department imposed the misuse of reseller permit penalty. We further determine that the business has not shown a basis for a waiver of interest or penalties. Accordingly, we deny the petition.",
