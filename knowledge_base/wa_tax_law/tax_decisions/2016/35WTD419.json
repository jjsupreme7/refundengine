  "summary": "Taxpayer appeals the assessment of service and other activities B&O tax on income derived from the rental of indoor space in a building where a swap meet is held. We conclude that the income is derived from granting a B&O taxable license to use realty and not a B&O exempt rental of real estate. While we sustain the future reporting instructions on a prospective basis, we grant Taxpayer\u2019s request for cancellation of the assessment based on erroneous previous written reporting instructions contained in a prior audit report.",
