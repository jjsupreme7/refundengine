  "summary": "A firm providing both architectural design and construction services protests reclassification of design work from the service and other B&O classification to the retailing business B&O and retail sales tax classifications on projects where it also acted as contractor. Because there is evidence that the parties contemplated that the Taxpayer would provide both services, we affirm the classification of the design work as a retail service. The Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
