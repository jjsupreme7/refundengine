  "summary": "A Washington construction contractor disputes the evasion penalty assessed on retail sales taxes that the contractor collected and used to meet its payroll, but did not remit to the Department. The contractor modified its QuickBooks records prior to an audit so that the invoices showed wholesale sales without sales tax, rather than the separately stated retail sales tax originally billed. Because the taxpayer knew the tax was due and altered its records to escape detection, we deny the petition but remand the assessment to adjust the amount due.",
