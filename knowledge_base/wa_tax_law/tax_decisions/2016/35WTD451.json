  "summary": "A computer service provider petitions for correction of an assessment and a refund, arguing that the Department erred when reclassifying certain separately stated charges as retail sales. Petitioner alleges that the charges were de minimis relative to the business\u2019s primary activity of providing help desk and consulting services, or were in relation to network-based services not subject to retail sales tax. Because the Department reclassified only line items on Taxpayer\u2019s own invoices that indicated retail sales activity, and because Taxpayer has not shown that the activities should be classified differently, we deny the petition.",
