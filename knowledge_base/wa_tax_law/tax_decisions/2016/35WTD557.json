  "summary": "An out of state limited liability holding company that provided payroll and benefits services to a subsidiary corporation, and that reported wages in this state as the employer of record, protests the assessment of B&O tax under the services and other activities classification on payroll expenses, arguing that amounts received for payroll and benefits are excluded reimbursements under WAC 458-20-111 (Rule 111). Because Taxpayer did not prove it had solely agent liability to pay the employer obligations, we conclude the amounts received are not excludible reimbursements. The petition is denied.",
