  "summary": "A business that organizes and hosts [vehicle] races protests the reclassification of rider participation/entry fee and comingled general admission/camping fees from the service and other B&O classification to the retailing business B&O and retail sales tax classifications. We affirm the assessment as issued. [U]nder RCW 82.04.050, WAC 458-20-183 [and ETA 3167.2011], the rider participation/entry fee allows for the participation in the sporting activity of [vehicle] racing and . . . is taxable as a retail activity. [Also,] the mingling of the service taxable general admission fees with the retail camping fees subjects the charge to the retail classification. The Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
