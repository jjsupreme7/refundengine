  "summary": "A Washington nonprofit corporation disputes an assessment of retail sales tax on receipts from its customers in exchange for marijuana. Because the marijuana was exchanged for money, a sale occurred. Because the corporation did not provide records of nontaxable transactions, retail sales tax was properly assessed on total sales. We deny the petition.",
