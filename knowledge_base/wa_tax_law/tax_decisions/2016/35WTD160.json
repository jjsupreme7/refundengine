  "summary": "Provider of training services petitions for correction of a letter ruling in which the Department instructed it to attribute income earned from its in-person and online training workshops to the location of each individual workshop participant at the time the training is provided. We revise the letter ruling. With respect to in-person workshops, a reasonable method of proportionally attributing income is to the location where the workshops take place. With respect to online workshops, income should be attributed to the participant\u2019s permanent office location because a reasonable method of proportionally attributing receipts is not available.",
