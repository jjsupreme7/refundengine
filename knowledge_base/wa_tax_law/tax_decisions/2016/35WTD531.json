  "summary": "Two corporate officers of a now defunct computer installation and repair business protest a TFAA issued against them as individuals, stating that the amount assessed against the defunct business was in error. We conclude that the corporate officers are responsible for the corporation\u2019s collected and unremitted retail sales tax and may not challenge the amount assessed against the underlying corporation.
