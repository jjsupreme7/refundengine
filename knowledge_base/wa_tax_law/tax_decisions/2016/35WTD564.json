  "summary": "A seller of vehicle tires protests the assessment of tire fees that Taxpayer failed to collect from its customers. Taxpayer argues that it received incorrect oral instructions from a Department employee, who reportedly advised Taxpayer that the tire fee requirement expired on June 30, 2010. Because it relied on this alleged incorrect information, Taxpayer argues it should not be liable for the tax assessment. We deny the petition.",
