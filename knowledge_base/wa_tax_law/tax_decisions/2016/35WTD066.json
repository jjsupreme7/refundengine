  "summary": "An aerospace manufacturer appeals the Department\u2019s denial of its refund request, based on reclassification of its business activities in a prior tax period to the preferential aerospace manufacturing B&O tax classification and the allowance of an aerospace B&O tax credit for that period. The Department denied the refund request on the basis that the manufacturer had failed to timely file its required annual report for the disputed period, and was therefore, not entitled to the tax benefits for that period. We conclude that the annual report was not timely filed and deny the petition.",
