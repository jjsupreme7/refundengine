  "summary": "A homeowner appeals the denial of a request for refund of retail sales tax paid on the purchase of metal roofing for his home, asserting that the roofing qualifies as M&E as a support facility that is integral and necessary for the solar energy system\u2019s generation of electricity. The taxpayer has not established that the roofing is integral and necessary for the solar energy system\u2019s generation of electricity; therefore, the roofing does not qualify as M&E exempt from retail sales tax under RCW 82.08.963 and WAC 458-20-263. The taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
