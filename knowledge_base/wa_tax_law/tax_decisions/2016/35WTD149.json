  "summary": "A political subdivision of the State of Washington (Taxpayer) protests a tax assessment, in which Taxpayer was assessed service and other B&O tax on \u201ctip fees\u201d collected from individuals that paid the fee to deposit their solid waste at a central transfer station owned and operated by a third party, but leased by Taxpayer. Taxpayer argues that its activity in relation to the central transfer station was an \u201cexclusively governmental activity\u201d and, therefore, exempt from B&O tax. We conclude that the activity at issue is an \u201centerprise activity\u201d subject to B&O tax. Accordingly, we deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
