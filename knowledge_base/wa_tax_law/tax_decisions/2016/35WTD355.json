  "summary": "A LLC that owns real property in Washington, appeals the assessment of REET on its transfer of a controlling interest, asserting that the transfer is exempt from REET because it was nontaxable under federal law, or was a mere change in form or identity. Taxpayer alternatively asserts that if REET is due on the transfer, the value of the LLC\u2019s real property is significantly less than that asserted by the Department.  We conclude that REET is due on the transfer, but the assessment must be adjusted to remove liability for a second parcel assessed in error, and to reflect a professional appraisal later submitted by Taxpayer. We grant the petition in part, deny it in part.",
