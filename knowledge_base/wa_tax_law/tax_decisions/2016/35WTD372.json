  "summary": "A manufacturer protests the Department\u2019s denial of Taxpayer\u2019s request for refund, in which Taxpayer claimed that it overpaid BNG use tax. Taxpayer argued that it should not have included (1) certain service fees or (2) the value of \u201clost and unaccounted-for\u201d natural gas in the measure for determining the amount of BNG tax owed. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
