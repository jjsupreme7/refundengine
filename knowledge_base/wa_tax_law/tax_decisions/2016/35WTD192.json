  "summary": "An out-of-state corporation appeals B&O taxes assessed on sales of its products delivered into Washington. The corporation contends that, because it had no property or employees in Washington, it was not obligated to pay Washington B&O taxes.  Because independent businesses demonstrated the corporation\u2019s products and solicited orders here on the corporation\u2019s behalf, the corporation had sufficient activity in Washington (nexus), and is liable for B&O tax on its receipts and income. Petition denied.",
