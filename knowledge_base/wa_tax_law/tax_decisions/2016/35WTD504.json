  "summary": "A private educational institution that provides educational programs solely through the internet, disputes the assessment of retail sales tax and B&O tax on certain charges to its students, arguing that fees for online educational programs are specifically excluded from the definition of \u201cdigital automated service\u201d and not subject to taxation as retail sales. We conclude that Taxpayer\u2019s fees for its online educational programs are not taxable as retail sales, and that Taxpayer\u2019s library and resource fees, science lab fees, and nursing program fees are tuition fees not subject to tax as retail sales. However, Taxpayer may owe use tax on certain property it used in this state as a consumer, for which sales tax was not paid. We grant the petition, but raise the issue of possible use tax liability and remand to the operating division for further findings and adjustments.",
