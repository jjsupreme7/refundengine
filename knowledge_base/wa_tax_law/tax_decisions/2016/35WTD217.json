  "summary": "A winery objects to the assessment of use tax on wine it provided free of charge for wine tasting and on items it gave free of charge to its wine-making class participants. The winery also protests the disallowance of the sales tax exemption it took for sales of wine to qualified nonresidents. The winery further asserts that tax should be waived because it relied on the erroneous tax advice and services of its accountant. We grant the petition in part and deny it in part.",
