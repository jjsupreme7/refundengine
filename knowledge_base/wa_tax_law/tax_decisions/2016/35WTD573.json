  "summary": "A small harvester, that retained an affiliated entity to harvest and market timber, objects to the disallowance of its harvesting and marketing cost deduction of 50 percent of the timber sale price in determining the measure of forest excise tax due. Where the taxpayer provides minimal documentation of harvesting and marketing costs, in addition to the absence of an arm\u2019s length transaction to verify the taxpayer\u2019s asserted costs, the Forest Tax Section appropriately applied the standard 35 percent cost deduction, as required by RCW 84.33.074(3)(b) and WAC 458-40-610(11). The taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
