  "summary": "A manufacturer, who deferred paying retail sales tax in a CEZ, appeals the tax assessed after the Department concluded that the manufacturer did not hire the requisite number of qualified employment positions based on the law in effect when the manufacturer applied for the deferral. In the alternative, the taxpayer asks to prorate the deferred tax for the qualified employment position it did hire. Because the manufacturer did not hire the requisite number of qualified employment positions, and there is no authority to prorate for the single qualified employment position, we deny the petition.",
