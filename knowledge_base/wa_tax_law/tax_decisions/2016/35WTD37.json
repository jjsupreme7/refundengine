  "summary": "A taxpayer appeals the refund denial of a late payment penalty, contending that payment of the assessment was late because the taxpayer worked with the Department in good faith to correct the amount of tax due. The taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied. We conclude that the taxpayer\u2019s circumstances in this case do not meet the statutory qualifications for waiver of a late payment penalty.",
