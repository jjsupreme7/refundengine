  "summary": "A parent company that provides a variety of \u201cgeneral and administrative services\u201d to various affiliated companies protests the method used by the Department\u2019s Audit Division to calculate an assessment of B&O tax. Specifically, Taxpayer argues that (1) the Audit Division included amounts that do not constitute gross income in Taxpayer\u2019s tax base, (2) the Audit Division used an unreasonable method of proportionally attributing Taxpayer\u2019s income from certain categories of services, and (3) it is entitled to a waiver of penalties. We grant the petition in part, deny in part, and remand for adjustment to the tax assessment.",
