  "summary": "A Washington state corporation disputes the Department\u2019s assessment of successorship liability for the unpaid taxes of a defunct business, based on Taxpayer\u2019s acquisition of the business\u2019s assets. We conclude that Taxpayer is a successor and is liable for the unpaid taxes of its predecessor. We further conclude that Taxpayer has not met its burden of proving that the fair market value of the assets it acquired from its predecessor is less than $50,000. Therefore, Taxpayer may not limit its successorship liability to the fair market value of the acquired assets. We deny the petition.",
