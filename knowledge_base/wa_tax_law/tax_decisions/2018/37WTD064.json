  "summary": "A provider of information technology services protests a tax assessment of additional service and other activities B&O tax from attributing additional gross income from two service contracts to Washington. Taxpayer argues that the gross income should be attributed to multiple states where the parties to the contracts allegedly contemplated the benefits from such contracts would be received. Taxpayer also argues that the Department should attribute the gross income from a third contract differently than Taxpayer originally attributed the gross income from that contract. We remand for application of a reasonable method of proportionally attributing gross income from the first two contracts, but deny the petition as it pertains to the third contract.",
