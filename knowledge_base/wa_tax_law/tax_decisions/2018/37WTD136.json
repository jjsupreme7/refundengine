  "summary": "A commercial bank in the business of originating, managing, and servicing credit cards, as well as promoting a network for its cards, petitions for correction of two assessments of B&O tax. In regards to the first assessment, Taxpayer asserts that it did not have sufficient nexus with the state of Washington to subject it to the B&O tax prior to the state\u2019s adoption of economic nexus. Alternatively, it asserts that the auditor\u2019s use of a single factor apportionment formula as opposed to a three factor formula for this period was in error. Finally, Taxpayer argues that the assessment of penalties is inequitable because the Department itself did not believe that sufficient nexus existed to tax the activities of credit card companies prior to the adoption of economic nexus. In regards to the second assessment, Taxpayer argues that the Department\u2019s failure to provide it with guidance regarding the proper treatment of cashback bonuses was a circumstance beyond its control that caused its underpayment of tax. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s position as it relates to nexus and the assessment of penalties. However, we grant it as it relates to the apportionment formula.",
