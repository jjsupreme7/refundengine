  "summary": "A taxpayer that renovated a facility to relocate a laboratory objected to the disallowance of the high technology retail sales and use tax deferral for portions of the project. The taxpayer asserted that an unfinished area should have been excluded in apportioning common area costs. The taxpayer also asserted that the area used for developing a new type of nuclear reactor qualifies for the deferral as development of an alternative energy source. The Department denies the petition.",
