  "summary": "A telecommunications company sought review of an assessment of service and other activities B&O tax imposed on receipts of USF support distributions. The taxpayer asserted that the Department cannot tax those receipts because the taxpayer previously paid B&O tax on the revenue it used to contribute to the USF. The taxpayer also asserted that the assessment should be waived based on the Department\u2019s silence on the issue in prior audits. The Department denies the taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
