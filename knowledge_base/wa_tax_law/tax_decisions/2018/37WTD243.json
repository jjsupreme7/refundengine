  "summary": "An individual domiciled [out-of-state] protests the assessment of use tax on a motor vehicle purchased in Washington and registered [out-of-state]. Because the individual owned property in Washington, worked in Washington, and spent significant time in Washington during the period in which the motor vehicle was purchased, he maintained sufficient ties to Washington to categorize him as a dual resident of Washington and [another state]. Therefore, he is not eligible for the nonresident use tax exemption for the motor vehicle in question and the assessment is affirmed.",
