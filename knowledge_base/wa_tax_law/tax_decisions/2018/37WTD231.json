  "summary": "A municipal corporation protests the imposition of leasehold excise tax on street obstruction permits issued to persons needing to obstruct the public\u2019s right of way during construction projects. Because the municipal corporation has a real property interest in the public\u2019s right of way, and because the permits allow the permit holder to exercise dominion and control over a specific location, the street obstruction permits create a taxable leasehold interest. The petition is denied.",
