  "summary": "A business that provides \u201ccrossfit\u201d training disputes re-classification of its income from the service and other activities B&O tax classification to the retailing B&O tax classification and the resulting assessment of [retail sales] tax. The business asserts the services it offers are primarily instructional in nature and distinguishable from retail physical fitness services offered by regular gyms. The business also requests waiver of penalties and interest because its owner was on active duty participating in an armed conflict when the tax liability accrued. The petition is denied in part and granted in part.",
