  "summary": "Taxpayers, a sole proprietorship retailing educational materials and a corporation providing training services for teachers and school districts, both owned by the same person, request cancellation of penalties and interest, alleging that their assessment payments were originally late due to errors made by the family member who handled the books and the extended illness of a second family member. Taxpayers also assert that the Department issued the assessments against the two registered businesses in error because they run the same business. We deny the petitions.",
