  "summary": "Taxpayer seeks waiver of late payment penalties on annual returns for 2015 and 2016 asserting that the late filing was due to a former accountant\u2019s fraudulent conduct and mismanagement. As the Taxpayer has not sufficiently substantiated the assertion of fraud or established that reasonable safeguards were in place, we find the requirements for a waiver under WAC 458-20-228 are not met and deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
