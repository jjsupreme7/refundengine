  "summary": "A Washington couple acting as one single independent distributor selling nutritional supplements for an incorporated [out-of-state] direct seller organization seeks refund of taxes assessed when the Department reclassified their reported gross income. Taxpayers dispute a decision by the Department to reclassify their income to the service and other activities B&O tax classification resulting in additional tax liability. Taxpayers state they relied on oral instructions from the Department to report their income as wholesaling, and contend they properly reported their income under the retailing, wholesaling, and royalties B&O tax classifications throughout the review period. We deny the petition.",
