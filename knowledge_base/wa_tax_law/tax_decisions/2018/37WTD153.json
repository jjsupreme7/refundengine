  "summary": "Taxpayer emailed a request for a binding tax ruling regarding the appropriate Washington B&O tax classification of its receipts. Taxpayer\u2019s request stated that Taxpayer coordinates and conducts international youth exchange programs in the United States and a number of foreign countries. Students pay Taxpayer to participate in the exchange program. Taxpayer indicated that it partners with other organizations, who pay a portion of the program fees that students pay to participate in the exchange programs. Taxpayer argued that because it provides transportation, hotel lodging, and meal services, all of its income should be classified under the B&O tax rate for tour operators in RCW 82.04.260(5) and WAC 458-20-258. We deny the petition and affirm the tax ruling.",
