  "summary": "An out-of-state corporation protests the Department\u2019s assessment made more than four years after the close of the tax year in which the tax was incurred. Taxpayer argues that it was a registered taxpayer under RCW 82.32.050(4)(a) and WAC 458-20-230(3) (Rule 230) because it registered with the Department in 1999, notwithstanding that it asked the Department to close its account prior to the Department\u2019s contact. We deny the petition.",
