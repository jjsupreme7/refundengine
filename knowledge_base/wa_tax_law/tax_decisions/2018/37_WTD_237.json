  "summary": "A Washington construction company protests the assessment of retailing B&O tax and retail sales tax on grounds that the Department of Revenue Audit Division erroneously classified Taxpayer as a prime contractor rather than a speculative builder. Taxpayer also contends that, if it is a prime contractor, it is eligible for tax paid at source deductions. We deny the petition in part and grant the petition in part.",
