  "summary": "An out-of-state grower of carrots that also makes \u201cbaby\u201d carrots from whole carrots, and sells such baby carrots, protests the assessment of B&O tax on such sales. Taxpayer argues that (1) it is entitled to \u201cdissociate\u201d its sales of baby carrots to customers in Washington, (2) the baby carrots were received by customers outside of Washington, and (3) Taxpayer\u2019s sales of baby carrots are exempt from B&O tax because Taxpayer is a farmer. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition . . . .",
