  "summary": "A manufacturer of silicon materials protests the denial of refund of retail sales tax that Taxpayer paid to third parties. Taxpayer argues that despite filing its refund request in 2015, it qualifies for refund on purchases invoiced in 2010, more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application was made, when it paid the retail sales tax in 2011. We grant the petition in part, and deny the petition in part, subject to verification by the Audit Division.",
