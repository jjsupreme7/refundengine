  "summary": "Taxpayer protests the assessment of additional REET, based on the assessed value of the property, and contends that REET was correctly paid on the total consideration received. We conclude that the sale at a 66% discount was not at the true and fair value and affirm REET assessed on the assessed value of the property. The Taxpayer\u2019s refund petition is denied.",
