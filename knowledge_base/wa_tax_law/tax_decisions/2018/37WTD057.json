  "summary": "A Washington corporation . . . protests the assessment of retail sales tax and retailing B&O tax based on an estimate of cash sales. While conceding the inaccuracy of electronic records, the business asserts that handwritten records provided are complete and accurate, and alternatively argues that the estimate used by the Audit Division is too high. [W]e affirm the conclusion that these records are not accurate and that the Audit Division reasonably exercised its authority to use an estimate. We also find that the estimate was reasonably calculated and find no evidence to establish that estimate rests on untenable grounds or constitutes an abuse of discretion. The Taxpayer also asserts that non-business income was incorrectly treated as business income. Because insufficient detail was provided to substantiate a non-business source for the remaining items, we affirm their categorization as business income. We affirm the assessment as issued and deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
