  "summary": "A taxpayer that charged customers to play in its basketball tournaments and leagues disputes the assessment of additional tax, penalties, and interest that resulted from reclassification of taxpayer\u2019s tournament and league revenue from the Service & Other Activities business and occupation (B&O) tax classification to the Retailing B&O tax classification. The taxpayer argues that RCW 82.04.050 and WAC 458-20-183 are unclear on their faces, that the taxpayer reasonably relied on the substantive tax advice of its professional accountant, and that Taxpayer has always filed its returns timely and accurately. We deny the petition.",
