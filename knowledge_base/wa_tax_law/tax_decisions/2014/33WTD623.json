  "summary": "Two affiliated limited liability companies (Taxpayers) engage in construction services.  Taxpayers protest the Department of Revenue\u2019s (Department) disallowance of bad debt deductions taken against retailing business and occupation (B&O) tax and retail sales tax. Taxpayers argue that they were eligible to claim the bad debt deductions for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, qualified for the deduction on their Washington combined excise tax returns. We disagree and deny Taxpayers\u2019 petition accordingly.",
