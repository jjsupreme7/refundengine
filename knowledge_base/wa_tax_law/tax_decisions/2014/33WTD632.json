  "summary": "A joint owner of real estate quitclaimed his one-half interest in the real estate to the other owner. Prior to the transfer the grantor was paying 50% of the mortgage payment but, after the transfer, the grantee began paying 100% of the mortgage payment on the property. The grantor petitions for refund of real estate excise tax (REET) paid on 50% of the outstanding debt on the property at the time of transfer. We deny the petition for refund, because the grantee relieved the grantor of his monthly mortgage payment, which constitutes consideration.",
