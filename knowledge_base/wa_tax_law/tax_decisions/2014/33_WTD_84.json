  "summary": "A clinic for treatment of asthma and allergies requests a refund of business and occupation (\u201cB&O\u201d) tax paid on receipts it received from patients on behalf of its owner, a doctor working for Taxpayer as an independent contractor. Taxpayer argues it is entitled to an exclusion from gross income because the payments qualify as advances under WAC 458-20-111. We affirm the refund denial because Taxpayer provided services to patients through an independent contractor, and because Taxpayer was not liable for payment to the doctor solely as an agent of the patients. Taxpayer\u2019s petition for refund is denied.",
