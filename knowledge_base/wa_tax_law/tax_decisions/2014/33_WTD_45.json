  "summary": "An operator of a wrecking yard that sells cars and car parts (Taxpayer) protests the assessment of retail sales tax and business and occupation (B&O) tax on grounds that the measure of taxes and allocation between retail and wholesale sales should be based on its general ledger rather than bank deposits and documentation of wholesale sales. Taxpayer also argues that certain sales are deductible from retail sales because they were made to qualified nonresidents. We deny the petition.",
