  "summary": "A used car dealership protests the assessment of use tax on executive use of dealership vehicles. As the Taxpayer does not have a recent model vehicle licensed in its name as required by WAC 458-20-132, we conclude that it is subject to use tax on use of an executive vehicle and sustain the tax assessed. The Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
