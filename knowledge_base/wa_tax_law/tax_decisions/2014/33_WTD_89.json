  "summary": "The owner of a car dealership (Taxpayer) challenges a tax assessment for additional tax liability due to Taxpayer\u2019s failure to accurately report its income and remit retail sales tax. Taxpayer argued that it is unable to provide records to support an adjustment to the tax assessment because his bookkeeper has refused to allow him access to his own records. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
