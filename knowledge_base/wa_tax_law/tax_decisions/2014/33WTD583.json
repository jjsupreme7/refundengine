  "summary": "Three LLCs that transferred real property for consideration that included the grantees taking the property subject to non-recourse mortgages, petition for reconsideration of a determination sustaining REET (Real Estate Excise Tax) assessed on the non-recourse debt included in the sales price. Because the WAC 458-61A-103(2) REET exemption applies only to transfers involving solely non-recourse debt, and no other consideration, we affirm the assessment of additional REET.",
