  "summary": "Out-of-state oil refinery and fuel seller (Taxpayer) petitions for reconsideration of Determination No. 13-0068, which ruled that Taxpayer has taxable nexus with Washington State through an exchange agreement with a [third-party supplier] fuel terminal in [City A, Washington]. Because the Taxpayer\u2019s customers are receiving the fuel in Washington State, and a third party is assisting the Taxpayer in maintaining its Washington market, nexus is created and we reaffirm the Department\u2019s finding.",
