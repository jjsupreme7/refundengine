  "summary": "The taxpayer, a building contractor on an active nonreporting status, collected retail sales tax from customers and did not remit it for several years. It appeals the 50% tax evasion penalty imposed on the amount of retail sales tax it collected but did not remit. Because the failure to remit these retail sales tax trust funds was intentional, we uphold the penalty.",
