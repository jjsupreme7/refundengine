  "summary": "Taxpayer, a club that offers live music and dining, petitions for the correction of assessment of an assessment of retail sales tax, retailing business and occupation (\u201cB&O\u201d) tax, and deferred sales tax. We hold that Taxpayer is required to charge retail sales tax on its mandatory gratuities, is liable for deferred sales tax on construction services related to a remodel of its club, and is responsible to remit over-collected retail sales tax it collected in error. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
