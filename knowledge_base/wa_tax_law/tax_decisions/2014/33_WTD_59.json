  "summary": "A taxpayer appeals the rescission of the rural county business and occupation tax credit for new employees authorized under chapter 82.62 RCW, and requests a refund of business and occupation tax paid as a result of the rescission. The Taxpayer Account Administration Division (TAA) of the Department of Revenue (Department) rescinded the credit because the taxpayer failed to file a second annual report required by the Department to verify the eligibility requirements of the tax credit have been met. The taxpayer argues the credit should be reinstated because it has now provided the report substantiating its eligibility for the credit, and because a second annual report is not mandated by statute. We grant the petition.",
