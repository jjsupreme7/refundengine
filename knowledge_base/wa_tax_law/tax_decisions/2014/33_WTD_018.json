  "summary": "Taxpayer, a business that provides \u201ccrossfit\u201d training, disputes re-classification of its income from the service and other activities business and occupation (\u201cB&O\u2019)  tax classification to the retailing B&O and retail sales tax classifications. Taxpayer maintains the services it offers are primarily instructional in nature and distinguishable from retail physical fitness services offered by regular \u201cgyms\u201d. We conclude that improving and maintaining physical conditioning was the primary focus of the classes at issue and sustain the assessment of tax on this income as retail physical fitness services. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
