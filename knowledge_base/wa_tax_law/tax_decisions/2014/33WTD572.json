  "summary": "A company operating a restaurant protests an adjusted assessment of tax for unreported cash sales, asserting that all sales were reported. We affirm the adjusted assessment because business records were insufficient and the Audit Division reasonably exercised its authority to arrive at an estimate of cash sales. We deny the Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
