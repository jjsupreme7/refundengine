  "summary": "A chiropractor protests the assessment of retail sales tax on sales of dietary supplements to patients, contending the sales are exempt from retail sales tax under RCW 82.08.925. Because chiropractors are not authorized under Washington law to prescribe drugs, we conclude the exemption does not apply and deny the petition.",
