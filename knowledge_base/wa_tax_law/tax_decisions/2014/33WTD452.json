  "summary": "A business selling school themed items, disputes the assessment of additional retail sales tax and retailing business and occupation (B&O), asserting that the assessment both overstates the measure of underreported income and also mischaracterizes commission income as retail sales. The Taxpayer has not provided sufficient records to show that the assessment is in error. The Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
