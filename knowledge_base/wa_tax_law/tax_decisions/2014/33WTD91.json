  "summary": "Taxpayer, a venue management, marketing, and development company, petitions for an adjustment of business and occupation (\u201cB&O\u201d) tax assessed on amounts paid to facility personnel and related costs incurred in the course of managing an event facility. These expenses were paid directly from the \u201cFacility Operating Account\u201d of the public facility district (\u201cPFD\u201d) that contracted with Taxpayer to manage a facility on its behalf. Taxpayer argues that B&O tax does not apply because: (1) no value proceeded or accrued to Taxpayer from the payments to facility personnel, and therefore the amounts cannot be considered \u201cgross income of the business;\u201d (2) even if such payments are valid consideration, the amounts paid from the Facility Operating Account qualify for [exclusion from B&O tax] under WAC 458-20-111 (\u201cRule 111\u201d); and (3) amounts paid to on-site personnel out of the Facility Operating Account are exempt from B&O tax under RCW 82.04.394 for periods prior to June 1, 2010. The Department denies Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
