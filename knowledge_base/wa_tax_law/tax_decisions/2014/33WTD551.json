  "summary": "Taxpayer, a federal records management contractor, protests the assessment of Business & Occupation (B&O) tax on income earned in Washington State where the work was performed by a subcontractor. Because the advice that it did not owe tax came from the subcontractor and a federal agency, and not the Department of Revenue, the Taxpayer owes the taxes as assessed.",
