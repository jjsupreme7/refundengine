  "summary": "A mutual fund advisor appeals a ruling that its gross income could not be taxed at the preferential rate for international [investment management] services. When the proportion of the advisor\u2019s income from investment management services to total income exceeds 50%, and 10% of their income comes from qualified clients, the advisor can pay business and occupation (B&O) tax on its income from investment management services multiplied by the preferential rate. We revise the ruling subject to verification.",
