  "summary": "A bank (Taxpayer) was denied a refund of retail sales tax because it had been granted a waiver of penalties and interest under RCW 82.32.052 (commonly referred to as \u201cAmnesty\u201d) for the same tax period. Taxpayer petitions for reversal of the denial claiming that amnesty for the penalties and interest owed on an unrelated Business and Occupation (B&O) tax liability did not bar it from receiving a refund of retail sales tax. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted.",
