  "summary": "Taxpayer leases digital equipment to movie theatres and also receives income in the form of virtual print fees from contracted movie distributors each time that distributor\u2019s movie is booked for showing on a theatre screen equipped with Taxpayer\u2019s leased digital equipment. Taxpayer protests the Department\u2019s reclassification of the income Taxpayer received from the virtual print fees from the retailing and the wholesaling business and occupation (B&O) tax classification to the service and other activities B&O tax classification. Further, although Taxpayer reported the VPFs under retailing, it now argues that the fees are properly taxable under the income from royalties B&O tax classification. We affirm the reclassification to the service and other business activities B&O tax classification and deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
