  "summary": "A timeshare association management company petitions for the correction of an assessment of service and other activities business and occupation (B&O) tax collected on housekeeping fees it charged to timeshare owners after their stay to clean the residences before the next timeshare owner takes possession of the unit. We hold that only the fees collected for the cleaning of common areas are deductible from Taxpayer\u2019s B&O tax base, which means that the housekeeping fees collected for the cleaning of the residences themselves are not deductible. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied",
