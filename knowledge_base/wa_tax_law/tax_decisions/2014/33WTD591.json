  "summary": "An out-of-state company protests the denial of a request for refund of Business and Occupation (B&O) tax for the period of October 1, 2007 through May 31, 2010, because it did not maintain a place of business in Washington during that time. We affirm the denial, because until 2006 the company employed a sales representative who visited Washington on its behalf, establishing nexus under RCW 82.06.067 and WAC 458-20-194.",
