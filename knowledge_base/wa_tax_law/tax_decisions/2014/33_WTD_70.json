  "summary": "A Washington corporation that owns and operates a cafeteria (\u201cTaxpayer\u201d) protests an estimated assessment for retail sales tax and retailing business and occupation (B&O) tax. Taxpayer also contends that the Department of Revenue (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) should not include the retail sales tax it has already remitted in the measure of its tax liability. We affirm the assessment because Taxpayer did not maintain records of its cash sales during the audit period, and because it did not separately state the retail sales tax on its sales receipts to its customers. We deny the petition.",
