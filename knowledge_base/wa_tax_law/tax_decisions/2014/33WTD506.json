  "summary": "A company (\u201cTaxpayer\u201d) primarily engaged in the business of collecting construction, demolition, and land clearing debris (CDL) and hauling it to third-party recycling facilities petitions for Executive Reconsideration of a determination concluding that: 1) Taxpayer\u2019s income from the collection and hauling of CDL to third-party recycling facilities for compensation is subject to the Service & Other Activities business and occupation (B&O) tax classification, rather than the Motor Transportation or Urban Transportation public utility tax (PUT) classification; 2) Taxpayer\u2019s rental of a trackhoe for use at its recycling facility does not qualify for the manufacturer\u2019s machinery and equipment retail sales tax exemption (M&E exemption); and 3) Taxpayer failed to establish that it paid retail sales tax on recycling containers at the time of purchase.  Taxpayer\u2019s petition is granted with regard to the first issue, but denied as to the remaining issues; however, with regard to the third issue, the Department will adjust the measure of the retail sales tax on the recycling containers to reflect the actual purchase price.",
