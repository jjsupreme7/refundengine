  "summary": "A person who digitally manipulates photographs for commercial customers to be used for online viewing protests the Department of Revenue\u2019s Taxpayer Account Administration Division\u2019s instructions that he must charge his customers retail sales tax. We conclude that Taxpayer is providing a retail activity taxable under the retailing classification of the B&O tax, but is not required to charge and collect retail sales tax for sales when customers provide Digital Products and Remote Access Software Exemption Certificates.",
