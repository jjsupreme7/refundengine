  "summary": "A taxpayer protests the Audit Division (Audit) of the Department of Revenue\u2019s (Department) revisions to an Audit assessment to correct a mathematical error found in the audit workbook. Because the revised assessment was less than the amount originally assessed, we conclude Audit was not barred from correcting the error. We deny the petition.",
