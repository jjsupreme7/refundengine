  "summary": "A nightclub appeals an assessment of retail sales tax and retailing business and occupation (B&O) tax on cover charges claiming that the charges should be taxed under the service and other activities B&O tax classification under RCW 82.04.050. Taxpayer also asserts that even if the cover charges are subject to the retail sales tax and retailing B&O tax, only a portion of the cover charge should have been classified as retail.
