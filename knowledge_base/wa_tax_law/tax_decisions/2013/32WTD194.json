  "summary": "A Washington business engaged in site preparation activities and extracting timber for sale, petitions for correction of an audit assessment that includes retailing business and occupation tax and retail sales tax on underreported income, and use and/or deferred sales tax on the purchase of a CAT excavator used for extracting timber. The taxpayer contends the Audit Division erred when it determined gross income based on the taxpayer\u2019s bank deposits, because the bank deposits include the proceeds of bank loans. The taxpayer also contends that logging equipment is exempt from retail sales and use tax. Because the taxpayer failed to provide any documentation regarding the bank loans, and because the purchase of equipment for extracting timber is not exempt from retail sales or use tax, we deny the petition.",
