  "summary": "Taxpayer appeals the denial of a refund request. Taxpayer asks the Department of Revenue to find it eligible for the preferential rate that applies to the Prescription Drug Warehousing Business & Occupation tax classification. We find that Taxpayer does not meet the requirements for the preferential rate because it is not registered with the federal drug enforcement administration and not licensed by the Washington board of pharmacy. We deny the petition.",
