  "summary": "This appeal involves two taxpayers: a sole proprietor and a limited liability company (LLC). The sole proprietor, engaged in the business of investing in real property, protests an assessment for retail sales tax on construction and laborer services provided on properties held in trust. The sole proprietor asserts that it is not liable for tax on the transactions because it was not the buyer. The LLC, an administrative entity for the trusts holding title to the properties, protests the protective assessment issued against it for the same tax. The LLC asserts that the sales of the services were not retail sales subject to retail sales tax. We affirm the assessments.",
