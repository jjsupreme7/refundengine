  "summary": "A retailer protests an assessment of retail sales tax claiming that certain sales should be exempt from tax because its records sufficiently document that the sales were to nonresidents. The retailer also protests deferred retail sales tax assessed on construction services it purchased for two projects in Washington, claiming that it should be allowed a credit for taxes it paid on these projects. Finally, the retailer asks that we waive interest included in the assessment because it made a good faith effort to comply with Washington law. We reverse deferred retail sales tax assessed on construction services performed in one of the projects at issue. Otherwise, we uphold the assessment.",
