  "summary": "A Washington resident and his wholly owned out-of-state limited liability company (LLC) appeal identical assessments of use tax and/or deferred sales tax on a vessel purchased in Washington, which they believed was delivered outside of Washington. Because the documents they provided the seller do not meet the requirements for an exempt sale to a nonresident or the requirements for a purchase for resale, we deny the petition.",
