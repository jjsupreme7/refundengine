  "summary": "A Washington corporation, which provides skydiving services, protests retail sales taxes assessed on its skydiving receipts and DVD sales. The corporation contends that its charges were for air commerce, preempted by federal law. Because skydiving is not air commerce, Washington may tax the skydiving charges. Charges to skydivers holding an A class parachute license and charges for instructional DVDs are retail sales. Petition denied.",
