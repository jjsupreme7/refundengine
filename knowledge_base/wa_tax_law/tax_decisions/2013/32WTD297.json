  "summary": "The Department of Revenue issued use tax assessments on a vessel to an out-of-state limited liability company (LLC) and to its members as individuals. Both the members and the LLC protest the assessments. The LLC argues that it is an out-of-state company and is exempt from the use tax because its use in Washington was temporary and constitutes a nontaxable use. The members argue that the LLC owns the vessel and they only used it as \u201cbailees.\u201d We deny both petitions.",
