  "summary": "An owner of a restaurant that failed to maintain source records protests Audit\u2019s use of an industry average percentage to determine cash sales and the assessment of retail sales tax. It contends its records and facts and circumstances reasonably prove its cash sales were less than the industry average percentage. We conclude the Taxpayer failed to maintain adequate records of cash sales, Audit\u2019s use of an industry average percentage was correct, and deny the petition.",
