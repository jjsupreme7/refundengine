  "summary": "An out of state company protests retail sales tax assessed on amounts it charged to rent cranes with an operator in Washington. The company did not own the cranes, but rented them in Texas where it paid retail sales tax, then shipped the cranes to Washington. We remand the assessment to the Audit Division to credit the taxpayer for Texas retail sales tax it paid against the use tax assessed during the period of its leases, as well as to adjust the assessment for any deferred sales/use tax that the subcontractor paid on the taxpayer\u2019s charges. Petition granted in part.",
