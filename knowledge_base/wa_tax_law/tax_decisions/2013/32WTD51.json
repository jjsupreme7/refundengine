  "summary": "Taxpayer protests the reclassification of income derived from providing a mobile video arcade from the service and other activities B&O tax classification to the retailing B&O and retail sales tax classifications. Taxpayer also argues that if the arcade\u2019s income must be reported as retail then a tax credit should be granted for the retail sales tax/use tax paid on the video game hardware and software when acquired. We conclude that: 1) Taxpayer\u2019s video arcade\u2019s income was correctly reclassified to retail; and 2) no retail sales tax refund is due on the purchase of game software or hardware.",
