  "summary": "A contractor protests the assessment of retailing B&O tax and retail sales tax on unreported income received from its subsidiaries for construction services performed on land owned by the subsidiaries. The taxpayer argues it is the owner of the land under the attributes of ownership test in WAC 458-20-170 (Rule 170). Accordingly, the taxpayer asserts it is a speculative builder and does not owe retail sales tax on its own labor. We conclude the taxpayer is not the owner of the land under Rule 170, and deny the petition.",
