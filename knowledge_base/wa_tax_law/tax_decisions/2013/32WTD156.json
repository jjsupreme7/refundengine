  "summary": "A retailer protests the denial of a bad debt deduction for sales tax paid that it received from private label credit card sales. The customers purchased retail goods and services from the taxpayer using banks\u2019 credit cards, but failed to pay the banks the amounts due on their accounts. Because the banks held the debt, the taxpayer was not entitled to claim a credit for bad debts on their customer\u2019s purchases using the banks\u2019 credit cards. Petition denied.",
