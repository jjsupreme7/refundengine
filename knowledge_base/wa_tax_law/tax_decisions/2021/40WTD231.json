  "summary": "Taxpayer seeks reconsideration of Determination No. 19-0185, which affirmed the disallowance of the M&E exemption from retail sales tax and use tax on plastic injection molds it purchased and provided to a vendor that used the molds to create plastic housing units for Taxpayer\u2019s \u201c[Hardware System]\u201d device. We find, on reconsideration, that Taxpayer is not a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of the plastic housing, because Taxpayer does not produce the plastic housing from its own materials or ingredients. . . . Taxpayer provided plastic injection molds to a vendor, so that the vendor could produce plastic housing units for Taxpayer. Taxpayer has provided no proof that it provided any material to the vendor other than the plastic injection molds. On these facts, Taxpayer was not the manufacturer of the plastic housing units. Stated differently, on these facts, the only entity who could be considered the manufacturer of the plastic housing units is the vendor. We sustain the holding in Det. No. 19-0185. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
