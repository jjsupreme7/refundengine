  "summary": "A logger protests the assessment of use tax on the purchase of a bulldozer used in its logging operations. The logger argues the bulldozer qualifies for the M&E use tax exemption because it is \u201cused directly\u201d in a manufacturing operation by providing physical support for manufacturing equipment. However, the logger also uses the bulldozer for non-manufacturing purposes and we find that the logger failed to prove that the bulldozer meets the \u201cmajority use\u201d requirement of the M&E exemption. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
