  "summary": "A business that operates a convenience store seeks a refund of its payment of an assessment of cigarette taxes, penalties, and interest on the grounds that it unknowingly purchased from its wholesale tobacco supplier cigarettes that lacked the required Washington stamp. Because the business possessed unstamped cigarettes, we find that the Department correctly imposed the subject taxes, penalties, and interest. Furthermore, because the business failed to present evidence that it possessed the unstamped cigarettes due to \u201cexternal circumstances,\u201d we find that the Department lacks \u201cgood reason\u201d to waive the subject penalties. Petition denied.",
