  "summary": "Two individuals protest the Department\u2019s assessment of REET on their transfer of real property to a limited liability company. The individuals argue that the transfer was exempt from REET as a mere change in identity or form. Alternatively, the individuals argue that the transfer was exempt from REET as the clearing of title. We deny the petition.",
