  "summary": "An [Out-of-State] development company protests the Department\u2019s assessment of retail sales tax and B&O tax on the grounds that the Department failed to provide the company with timely notice that the Department had issued the assessment, thus rendering the assessment invalid. The company also argues that, even if the assessment is valid, the associated delinquency penalty was improperly assessed because the company filed and paid its monthly tax returns on time. Because the Department\u2019s secure messaging system shows that the Department timely transmitted the assessment to the company, we find that the Department complied with its statutory duty to provide notice and the assessment is valid. We also find that the delinquent penalty was properly assessed. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
