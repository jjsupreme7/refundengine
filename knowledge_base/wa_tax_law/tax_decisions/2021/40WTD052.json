  "summary": "An auto parts seller seeks review of an assessment issued by the Department. Taxpayer objects to the Department\u2019s use of estimated sales amounts in calculating Taxpayer\u2019s tax liability. Taxpayer also objects to the Department\u2019s reclassification of income from the Wholesaling B&O Tax Classification to the Retailing B&O Tax Classification and retail sales tax, as well as the Department\u2019s denial of tax exemptions for sales outside of Washington. We grant the petition in part, deny in part, and remand for adjustment to the tax assessment.",
