  "summary": "A taxpayer that, in relevant part, provides support services to an affiliate that owns restaurants in Washington State disputes the assessment B&O tax on certain expenditures. First, Taxpayer contends that certain costs were erroneously duplicated in the audit, resulting in an overstatement of tax due. Second, Taxpayer argues that certain expenditures do not constitute gross income, because they were paid solely on behalf of its affiliate and constituted non-taxable advances and reimbursements.Third, Taxpayer argues, alternatively, that it never actually received payment from its affiliates for the services it purchased, that journal entries were made solely for internal management purposes, and [the amounts posted] are \u201cimputed income\u201d not subject to B&O tax.Finally, Taxpayer requests a waiver of delinquent penalties and substantial underpayment penalties. We grant the petition with regard to the issue of duplication errors in the audit and some charges that were billed solely to affiliates, and deny the petition as to the remaining issues.",
