  "summary": "An individual protests the imposition of REET on two transfers of real property from the individual to a LLC owned in part by the individual. Because the LLC paid the mortgage debt from the origination of the mortgage and continued to do so after the individual transferred the real property to the LLC, there was no consideration for the transfer. The petition is granted.",
