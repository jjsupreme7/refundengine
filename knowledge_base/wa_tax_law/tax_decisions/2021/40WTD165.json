  "summary": "A business protests the denial of a request for a refund of retail sales tax. The business collected the retail sales tax from clients on sales of personal training services, and remitted said taxes to the Department. The business later discovered that such services are not subject to retail sales tax. We find that the business is not entitled to a refund of the retail sales tax because it was the client, not the business, that paid the tax, and the business has not provided any evidence that it has refunded the taxes to the client. The petition is denied.",
