  "summary": "A now-dissolved Washington company (\u201cTaxpayer\u201d) that owned the real property assets of a dairy farm protests the Department\u2019s assessment of [deferred sales] tax on purchases of upgrades to a livestock nutrient management system. Taxpayer argues that because an affiliated company operates the dairy farm and other state agencies treat both companies as \u201cdairy operators,\u201d Taxpayer qualifies as an \u201celigible person\u201d and the purchases are tax-exempt under RCW [82.08.890]. Because Taxpayer does not meet the definition of an \u201celigible person\u201d and we treat separately-organized companies individually for tax purposes, Taxpayer is not entitled to the [sales] tax exemption. Petition denied.",
