  "summary": "An automotive maintenance and repair company protests the Department\u2019s assessment of retail sales tax on certain sales of auto parts on the grounds that it sold the parts to a nonresident. The company also seeks a refund of retail sales tax collected from Washington customers on sales that occurred while both the company and the customer were outside the state. We find that because the company charged the nonresident more than the company\u2019s costs for the parts and failed to provide adequate documentation regarding the nonresident\u2019s residency, an adjustment of the assessment is not warranted. We also find that the company is not entitled to a refund of the allegedly erroneously-collected sales tax because it did not first refund the taxes to its customers. Petition denied.",
