  "summary": "A real estate development company protests the Department\u2019s denial of its request for a refund of REET paid on the sale of real property from the company to purchasers. The parties later rescinded the sale and the purchasers returned the property to the company in return for a refund of all consideration the purchasers had paid. We find that the transfer of the property back to the company following the rescission is an independent transaction and a rescission does not alter the fact that the initial sale to the buyers was subject to REET. Taxpayer\u2019s petition is denied.",
