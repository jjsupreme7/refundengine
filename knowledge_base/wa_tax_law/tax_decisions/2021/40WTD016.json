  "summary": "A Washington corporation petitions seeking correction of an audit assessment by the Department. In its petition, Taxpayer asserts that amounts it received from an affiliated business were not taxable income but were instead owner investment funds. Taxpayer argues that these amounts were previously taxed as income to the affiliated business and this represents a double tax on the same amounts. Taxpayer also contests the Department\u2019s coding of this income for local sales tax purposes, contending that, if it is recognizable as income, the related taxable activity should be coded to a different location. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
