  "summary": "A Washington property owner objects to the Department of Revenue\u2019s disallowance of [a] harvest cost deduction and revised assessment of timber excise tax (Timber Tax) on the sale of harvested timber.1 Taxpayer argues that the value he negotiated and paid for standing timber, during the purchase of a parcel of forest property in 2015, should be accepted by the Department as a deductible harvesting and marketing cost against the gross receipts from sale for calculating timber tax due upon harvest and sale in 2018. We deny Taxpayer\u2019s petition.",
