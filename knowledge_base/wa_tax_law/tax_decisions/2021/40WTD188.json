  "summary": "A Washington hunting guide protests the Department\u2019s assessment of retail sales tax and penalties on the grounds that hunting guide services were not subject to retail sales tax until January 1, 2016, and, regardless, the guide was unaware that it was required to collect sales tax. We find that hunting guide services were indeed subject to retail sales tax throughout the audit period and the guide\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding its tax liability is not a valid basis for a penalty waiver. Petition denied.",
